VIRGIL AND Hls ANOIENT CRITIOS. xxxv

etiam latinam etymologiam,’' 110. Hyginus (ap. Geli. 7. 6) blamed
the phrase praepetibus peusis, which was defended hy parallele from
Ennius and Matius. Gellius 10. 29. 4 says that in G. l. 203 atque was
thought obscure, and interprete it as = statim so Nonius, p. 530. The
phrase tunicam squalentem curo was again defended by ancient example
(Gellius 2. 6. 19). Servius on A. 12. 517 (Dan.) says 0101011111
that line “ quaeritur saue quis primus ecorum pro peroso dixerit.’'

From these criticiems, which attribute to Virgil the invention 01
new words, 01 1 new 011110 application 01 old ones, we should be
carefnl to separate ench remarks as that 01 Cornutus on oerore
(Gellius 2. 6= Macrobius 6. 7. 1) “incuriose et abiecte in his versibus
verbum posuit; ’' on inlaudati Busiridis: “ hcc enim verbum inlaudati
nou est idoneum ad exprimendam sceleratissimi hominis detesta·
tionem ; '’ aud that quoted from the same writer on the words dicarat
1110 aliquid maguum by Servius on Aen. 10. 547, “ Cornutus nt sor-
didum improbat.'‘

The notes 01 Gellius aud Macrobius on secare and inlaudatus, it
should be observed‚ throw fresh light ou the relation 01 the Servius 01
the Saturnalia to the 1011 Servius, who has the remark on occare
(11016. 75 ⁴) in a shorter form, and without any mention of objections3
while in his note on inlaudatus (Georg. 3. t) he takes no account oi
the discussion carried on in Gellius and Macrobius, bnt simply ex·
plains the word as=qui laudari ucu debeat. With these criticisms
compare Servius on Aen. 8. 731, “1111110 versum notant critici quasi
superfluo et inutiliter additum, nec convenientem gravitati eius,
namque eet magis neotericns;” Aen. 11. 53, “1100 qnidam ἀνέκδοτον
(amatur) 01 vulgare accipiunt3 sed decenter ad exprimendum patris
adfectum nunc ad patrem redit.'' '

III.

I now come to consider some 01 the criticiems made upon Virgil’s
management 01 his story in the Aeneid. Macrobius 1. 241 2speaks
01 “ multa pudenda . . . in dispositione operis.’'

ln the Ars Poetica (143 1011.) Horace lays down the principle that
the Homeric order of narrative (as distinguished, for instance, we may
suppose him to mean, 110111 that 01 Apollonius Rhodius) is that which
an epic poet ought tc 1011011 :

“Non fumum ex fulgore, sed ex fumo dare lucem
Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc 1111110011 promat,

ugm'l'he21emoviesnsis here adds the 111110 illustratione ot 00111111 are giren in
