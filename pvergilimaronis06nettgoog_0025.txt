LIFE OF VIRGIL. xri

and a home to him and his father. This poem has as good a claim to
acceptsnce as any in the collection3 but the thirteenth, the author of
which speaks ot himself aa a soldier accustomed to hard campaiguing,
cannot possibly be by Virgil. The third (Aspice qvam calido subnixum
picria raquo) may very well, asI have argued elsewhere,⁸ apply to
Phraates, and in that case must belong to the year 32 s.c., the thirty-
eighth of Virgil’s age. Considering this fact it cau hardly, perhaps,
be prononnced worthy oi him. Oi the sixth and the twelfth all that
can be said is that they are lampoons in the manner oi Catullus.
Two poema (4 and 11) are addressed apparently to Octavius Musa, an
historiar of note. 'Phe authorship both of these aud of the reat of the
collection remeius at present uncertain.

But, whatever be the case with regard to these poema, we must
lcolr to the Eclogues and Georgica it we would learn anything of the
studies and political leanings of Virgil's early manhood. Το take
the last point first, it must never be forgotteu that Virgil's boyhood
was passed iu the full blane of Julius Caesar's glory. Virgil was a
boy oi fifteen when Caesar invaded Britain3 au expedition which im-
pressed the fancy even oi the hostile Catullus. And there were
nearer ties which bound Virgil's native country to Caesar. 11149 nc.
(the twenty-first ot Virgil’s age) Caesar, who had for nineteeu years
Ι been patron oi Gallia Transpadana, conferred the Roman citizenship
onita inhabitants. 'Phe whole career of the Dictator must, in fact,
have deeply impressed the imagination of the young poet. The
literary men of the previous generation had mostly espoused the cause
of the republic; but a change, for which the course of events quite
sufficiently accounts, began with Sallust, Virgil, and Varius. If the
fifth Eulogue is rightly referred to Julius Caesar, we may take this
poem as well as the conclusion oi the first Georgic as Virgil’s tribute
to the man whom he regarded as the saviour of his country.

Turning now to Virgil's early studies, it is clear from the Eclognes
and the Georgica that they were mainly devoted to the Alexandrian
poets, and among the Roman poets to Lucretius (witness the sixth
Eclogue), to Helvius Cinna, and to Varius. These last he expreasly
mentions as writers whose fame he would fain emulate if he could.⁹
Helvius Cinna, whose poemen Smyrna, admired oi Catullus, had
occupied him nine years, is said in a notice preserved by Philargyrins
to havc given the occasion for Horace's precept “nonumque prematur
in annum.’' We may conjecture that he was admired by Virgil as
setting an example of severe learning and minute study of form.
