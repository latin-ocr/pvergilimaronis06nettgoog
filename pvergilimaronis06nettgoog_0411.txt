GEORGICON LIB. III. 291

Pelion hinnitu fugiens implevit acuto. ⁹

Hunc quoque, ubi aut morbo gravis aut iam segnior annis
Deficit, abde domo, uec turpi ignosce senectae: 96 ’
Frigidus in Venerem senior, frustraque laborem
Ingratum trahit3 et, si quando ad proelia ventum est,
Ut quondam in stipulis magnus sine viribus ignis,
Incassum furit. Ergo animos aevumque notabis 100
Praecipue3 hinc elias artis, prolemque parentum,
Et quis cuique dolor victo, quae gloria palmae.
Nonne vides, cum praecipiti certamine campum
