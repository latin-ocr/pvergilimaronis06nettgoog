THE ΤΕΧΤ OF VIRGIL.

Tun text of Virgil has been handed down in the condition which
might be looked for when we remember the fact that his poems had
become a school-hook within half a century after his death, and had
thus been often copied aud passed through tbe hands of innumerabis
scholars and schoclmasters3 so that, literally and metaphorioally‚
10100 decolor esset 1100000, ct 10000001 cipro fuligo Maroni. Hyginus
at the beginning, and Probus towards the end, of the first century aa,
were (as we have seen) already compelled tc raiae questions ou the
text of Virgil; a circumstance which may give us 0 fair idea cf tha
fortunas which were already beginning to befal it.

The manuscripts on which our text of Virgil is mainly based are the
Vatican fragment, the St. Gall fragment, the Medicean, the Palatino,
the Roman, the fragments of the Verona palimpsest, and the so-called
Augustean fragment.¹ All these manuscripts are written in uncial
characters, and belong at latest to the fifth century aa, though noue
oi them,² it would seem, need necessarily he assigned to an earlier
date. lndeed, the mistakes iu which they all abeund-mistakes which
in many cases imply 0 defective knowledge of classical Latinity-
point with much probability to the end of the fourth or the begin-
ning of the fifth century. Iwill give a specimen from a passage in
the third Georgia (181-214) which is preserved in 011 the 000101

¹Neither the Medioeau nor Palatina nor Roman are complete throughout.
stNot even the Angusteau fragment, which was 01 first assigned tothe Anputan
ege, and named accordingly.
