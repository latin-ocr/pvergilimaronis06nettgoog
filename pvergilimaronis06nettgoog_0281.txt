GEORGIOON LIB. Ι.

Ρο0, ovium custos, tua si tibi Maenala curae,

Adsisr, o Tegeaee, favens, oleaeque Minerva

Inventrix, uncique puer monstrator aratri,

Et teneram ab radice ferens, Silvane, cupressum, 20
Dique deaeque ornnes, studium quibus arva tueri,
Quique noras alitis non ullo semine fruges,

Quique satis largum caclo demittitis imbrem ;

Tuque adeo, quem mox quaa sint habitura deorum
Concilio, incertum est, urbisne inrisere, Caesar, 25
Terrarumque velis curam, et te maximus orbis
