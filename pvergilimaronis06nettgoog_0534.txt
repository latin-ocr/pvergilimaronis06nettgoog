ΟΝ THE LtTEss

Felicisque vocnt teneant quae membra catenas.
Et postquam poenae¹ eausam cognovit ab ipsa,
Destinat in thalamos per bellum vadere ponti,

Altera si Gorgo veniat, non territus ire.”

But 1 must redeem my promise ot analyziug en entire portion of the
poem, the first hook.

Maniliusproposes his subject, characterizing it very hrieflyas“divinas
artis et conscia fati Sidera,'diversos hominnm variantia casus,” and
recommending it as a new strain, which is to shake the woods of Heli-
con. With equel brevity, Caesar, the worthy heir oi a world which
the gods gave to his father, is acknowledged as the poet’s inspiring
deity. When the universe isat peace, the secrete of the universe may
be most fitly unfolded. The poet kindles fire on two altars, aud ieels a
twofold hcet, the heat of song and the hcet of his subject, which is no
less than the world itself. Who first revealed such divine secrete to
men? Who but the gods? It was Mercury who first disclosed the
wondrous incrementa ol the stare: Nature assisted in the work oi
making herself known, aud taught Egyptian and Assyrian kings to
scrutiuize that heaven which their power so nearly reached. The next
step was made by the priests, who, longfamiliar with divine things, were
allowed to perceive the intluencc ot the stars ou human life. Kuow·
ledge was reduced to a system: occult lawe were discovered, and the
universe was seen to be reguleted by eternal reason. Till then all was
uncertainty ι men wept to find stars vanish‚ and were rejoiced at their
reappearance. These were, indeed, days oi darkness, when earth was
untilled‚ mines unworked‚ the sea annavigated, and every one thought
his stock oi knowledge enough. Time, penury, aud experieuce worked
the cure, and taught language, agriculture, commarca, and the arts of¹
war and peace 3 nay (to pass from more hackneyed tapies), taught divi·
nation, magio, and necromancy, and did not stop till they had mounted
up to heaven and·studied nature’s operatione, the causes of thunder,

conflagratione, earthqnakes, rain and wind, and the reason why winter
snow is softer than summer h'ail; till the fiery holt had been wrested

from Jove and transferred to the clouds. Hence came the knowledge
of the stara, thc poet’s present subject, which he hopes to be permittcd
to pursue through the gentle decline oi a long life.

First he undertakes to describe the appearance oi the universe,
glaucing, aa he pasees, at the various theorica oi its origin, chaotic or
atomio, Vulcanian or Neptunian, a problem which he seems to think
beyond divine no less than human comprehension. The upper part oi
the mundane system is fire, next comes air, which serves as it were to
fan the fleme: thirdly water, which iu like manner ieeds the air hy its
exhalationes lestly earth, which occupies st once the lowest place aud
the ceutre, the other clemente falling off fremit in equal proportions on
