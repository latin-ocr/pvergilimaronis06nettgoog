212 Ρ. VERGILI MARONIS

Fulgura, nee diri totiens arsere cometae.

Ergo inter sesa paribus concurrere telis

Romanas acies iterum videre Philippi; 490
Nec fuit indignum superis, bis sanguine nostro
Emathiam et latos Haemi pinguescere campos.

Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis

Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro,

Exesa inveniet scabra robigine pila,

Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanis,

Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.
