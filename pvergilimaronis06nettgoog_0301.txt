Atque illum in praeceps prono rapit alveus amni.

2. 169, where see the note. The metap hor
here is sufficiently explained by what
follows, the fates answering to the cur·
rent, the course of nature to the bark,
and human labour to the rower. The
general sense is not unlike Bacon' s cele·
brated sentence (Essay 24),ι ‘If time 'of
course alter things to the worse, and wis-
dom and counsel shall not alter them to
the better, what shall be the end?'' Pal.

203.] The traditional explanation since
Gellius (9. 29: Nonius,p 530) makes
‘’atque- - “statim,” accordingly. But
the usage of Virg. in similes of this sort
(as a friend has ‘’remarked ιο ιιιο) is in
favour of connecting ‘'atque with‘ re-
misit. He does ιιοι expressly introduce
an apodosis οιι such occasions, but makes
his whole sentence depend on the‘ quam’
or‘ si ’which follows the‘ non aliter? or
‘haud secus ’following the simile. Comp.

‘non aliter, quam' to complete the sen·
tence grammatically‚ the subject of it
being the rower, ‘qui. ,subigitJ ‘’Illum
is doubtless the lembus' which is dis-
tinguished from the rower. So in Catull.
65. 23, ιιιο original of the present line
(quoted by Keightley, who however mis-
takes “atque,'’ which couples “ agitur”
with “ excutitur,'’ or perhaps with “pro-
currit ’'), “Atque illud prono praeceps
agitur decursn,” “illud” is contrasted
with “hnic.” Wagn. accounts for ‘atque'

‚ aas&

by supplying‘ retro sublapsus refertur’
before it, and making the whole into an
apodosis; bnt he notes no similar in-
stance. Several ot er views have been
or might be suggested, with more or less
plausibility: none of them, however,
seems to have any real likelihood as
against that adopted above. ‘’Alveus

easy to infer the notion of the current.
