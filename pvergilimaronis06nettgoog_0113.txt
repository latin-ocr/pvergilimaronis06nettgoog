THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. cix

version 01 Philargyrius says “ut poetae Graeci fabulantur,’' the Berne
scholia naming Alcman as the Greek poet. Here Servius again has
quite a different note. Sempronius Asellio is cited hythe Berne scholia
alone on G. 3. 474, Caelius Antipater on G. 0197 (where Philargyrius‘
note is lost in our version), Asper on G. 4. 238, Nigidius Figulus on
G. 1. 174. 428, 498 (in all 01 which passages, again, the notes 01
Philargyrius are lost), G. 2. 168, 0οᾶ Suetonius on G. 4. 564. For
other instances where the Berne scholia hare notes oi value I must
referto the commentary, where I have quoted from them whenever
they offered anything worth precer-ring.

Readers who hare had the patience to follow this essay thus far will
be prepared for the conclusion at which J am inclined to arrive, that a
large body 01 Virgilian learning had accumulated hythe end 01 the
fourth century 00, the greater and by tar the most valuable part 01
which was at least as old as the age 01 Trajan, and much even older3
and that from these materiale it was that the author or authors 01 the
Verona scholia, Philargyrius, Macrobius, Servius, and the authorities
followedby the Barna scholia, drew their information independently 01
each other. This hypothesis will I hope be found to account for the
considerable number 01 instances in which they agree, and the number,
perhaps hardly less considerable, in which they exhibit independence
or divergence.
