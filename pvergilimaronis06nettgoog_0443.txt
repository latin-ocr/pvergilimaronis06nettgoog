GEORGIOON LIB. III. 323

Qui, dum amnes ulli rumpuntur fontibus et dum

Vere madent udo terrae ac pluvialibus austris,

Stagna colit, ripisque habitans, hio piscibus atram 100
Improbus ingluviem ranisque loquacibus explet3
Postquam exusta palus, terraeque ardore dehiscunt,
Exsilit in siccum, et flammantia lumina torquens

Saevit agris, asperque siti atque exterritus aestu.

Ne mihi tum mollis sub divo carpere somnos, 100
N en dorso nemoris libeat iacuisse per herbas,

Cum positis novus exuviis nitidusque iuventa

Volvitur, aut catulos tectis aut ova relinquens,
Arduus ad solem, et linguis micat ore trisulcis.
