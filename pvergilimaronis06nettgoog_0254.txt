he regarded as necessary to the conduct of lile iu an agricultural eom·
munity. Butalter prose writing had come to be studied, didactic poetry
of this kind was no longer possible. It might linger on among the
nnedncated: but among the cultivators ol composition as an art, those
who wished really to instruct were sure to write in prose. Theophrastus
took the place of Hesiod by the same law which gava the chair of
Xenophanes and Empedocles to Plato aud Aristotle. The Hesiodio
lorm however remaiued alter its spirit had passed elsewhere. The
union of practical teaching with the charms of versification continued
to be attempted by writers who lorgot to ask themselves under what
circumstances that uniou had first been realized. It was easy to pro·
duce something more systematis than the Works and Days, while the
discovery oi images appropriate to rural life, yet not unsuited to the
dignity oi the Muse, iurnished a sufficient employment to the poet's
lancy. 'Phe poetical grammarians ol Alexandria were naturally at·
tracted to a species of composition which, though perhaps incompatible
with a spirit of profound criticism, has peculiar points of affinityto the

’ temper of a critical age: and the Alexandrianiaing poets of Rome were

not unwilling to follow the example. The Phaenomena of Aratus found
at least two distinguished translatore: Lucretius and Manilius gave the
form and colour of poetry to the truths of science, Virgil aud Horace
to the rules oi art ; aud the rear is brought up by such poets as Gratius,
Nemesianus, and Serenus Sammonicus. In the so-called Augustanage
of English literature the same canses were seen to produce the same
effecte. We had Essuys on satire, Essays ou Unnatural Flights iu
Poetry, Essays on Translated Verse, Essays on Critieism, Essays ou
Man: Arta of Proserving Health‚A1ts of Dancing‚ and evenhrts of
Oookery: the (these, and the Fleece, and the Sugar-cane. Some ol
these the world has lorgotten: others are still read with pleasure, not
however lor the precepta contained iu them, but for the terso languago
aud polished verse iu which those precepts are enforced. But whatever
may be their beauties, the Hesiodic spirit is absent from one and all
alike. If we are resolved to track it to its lurking·places iu English
poetry‚ we must ascend to times more nearly resembling Hesiod’s own,
when old Tusser could write, not for critice, but for termera, and the
Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry were received as respectable
poetry because they were known to be good sense.

Colonel Mu're rightly remarks⁶ that the Worlrs aud Days might be
more correctly described as a Letter ol Remonstrance and Advice to a
Brother. It is round the grasping, lazy, improvident Perses, μέγα νήπιε

Πέρση, as his brother calls him more than once, that the whole poem ‘
