THE LATEXR DIDAOTIO POETS OF ROME.

Hsvme spoken oi the Latin Pastoral writers who came after Virgil, I
may naturally be expectedto say something of his successore in Didactie
Poetry. It is true that the two cases are not precisely parallel: in
the one not only the kind oi poetry, but the subject, was the same as
Virgil’s own: in the other the similarity merely affecte the form, and
does not extend to the matter. Like Virgil, Calpurnius and Neme-
sianus sang of the contests, the loves, the laments of shepherds: unlike
Virgil, Manilius, Gratius, Nemesianus, and Serenus Sammonicus, sing
of astronomy and astrology, of the chase, and ol the cure oi diseaees.
Here, however, as in the Introductory Essay to the Georgics, I am
addressing those who, like myself, are studente ol Roman poetry, not
studente of Roman agriculture, so that I shall need no apology for
devoting a short time to the examinatiou of writers whose werke
resemble the Georgica, as the Georgics themselves resemble nottho
treatises of Cato and Varro, but the poems of Lucretius. These writers
of course will be themselves considered simply with reference to their
form: to discuss their matter is a tesk which is fortunately beyond my
purpose, as itis certainly beyond my ability.

The most considerable Latin Didactie poem subsequent to the
Georgics is uuquestionably the Astroaemicol oi Manilius. It is
divided into five books, consisting respectively of 926, 970, 682, 935,
and 745 lines, so that its length is nearly double that of Virgil's work.
Its date is still au unsolved problem. No allusion to it occurs in any
ancient writers: it is not even quoted by asingle grammarian: indeed,
there is uo trace of its existence till the eleventh century, which also
happens to be the probable date of its earliest MS.; while, on the other
haud, its own internal evidence, as estimated by the most competent
critice, would seem to referit tothe reign of Tiberius. Professor

11 have adopted the forms “Astronomiea,” “dynastia’' da, rather then
“Astroucmieon,” “ Oynegetioon,” whloh seem to be merely genitivos belonging to
the omitted substantive ‘⁶ liber'’ or “ libri,” as the Latin title of the Georgics shows.
Similar mistakes were made by early English writers, who telked about Virgil’s
“Aeneidos,”and are not uneommonly made by modern English bookbinders. Pliny
however (H. N. 32. 11) seems to regard “Heliconem” as a neuter singular.
