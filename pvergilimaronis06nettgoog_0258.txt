138 GEORGIOA.

01 1110, his direction about which occupy more than fifty lines, the sum
01 the whole being a cantion to avoid ill repert. “ Ill repert 11 0 light
load to take up, but a heavy one to carry, and a hard one 10 shake 011 :
101 no repert dies altogether which bas been reported of many people:
for it has something 01 the god in it.” The last series 01 preceptsis
about the lueky and unlucky days 01 the mouth, which 011 enumereted
witha fuluess contrasting strangely with Virgil’s brief notice 01 the
subject. “Different men,’' concludes theold bard, “praise different
days, but 1011 have any knowledge: sometimes a day is a stepmother,
sometimes a mother: wheretore blessed and happy is he that has know·
ledge 01 all, end werke his work unblamed by the immortale, distinguish-
ing omens, and avoiding occasions to transgress.'’

I bave thought it worth while to give this sketch 01 Hesiod’s poem,
endeavouring to preserve something 01 its oolour as well as its form,
that it may be seen how far removed it stende in its rude simplicity
from the pomp and circumstance 01 later didactic poetry, and how little
Virgil understood 01 his author’s genius 01 his own when he spoke 01
himself as ainging the song 01 Ascra through the towns 01 Rome. The
Iliad and Odyssey, 11 modern criticism will allow us to eny‘oy them in
their integrity, might easily be shownto possess most 01 those requisites
which the writer 01 the Aeneid and the grammariane whom he not im·
probably followed doubtless considered the invariable elementa 01 an
epie poem: but even though the Works and Days should be judged to
have successfully resisted the solvent power 01 German analysis, its
relation as a whole to the Georgica must still be regarded as one 01
contrast rather than 01 similarity. But where a poet avows himself an
imitator, traces 01 imitation are not likely to be wanting in hia work:
and though Virgil has not followed Hesiodus closely or as constantly
as he has followed Theocritus or Homer, the instances 01 resemblance
between them in points 01 detail are neither few nor equivocal. Even
· the pervading philosophy, 11 10 11 may be called, 01 the Works and
Days‚ the philosophy 01 labour, reappeers, with no perceptible loss 01
reality, as tbe animating soul 01 the Georgica, though the plain direct·
neas with which itis entorced in the one affords a significant eontrast
to the 0111111 dexterity with which it is insinuated in the other· The
picture 01 the Five Ages doubtless suggested Virgil's lines on the
transition from the reign 01 Saturn to the reign 01 1 010, which in their

turn supplied some hints to Ovid when be set himself to reproduce the
Hesiodic narrative at the opening 01 his Metamorphoses. The story 01
Prometheus has no counterpart in Virgil, except so fer as it may have
taught him that an episode may 1111111111 an agreeable reliet in didactic
poetry, and so bave given rise to the narratives which conclude his
third and fourth books; but the moral 011110 story, the duty 01 sub·
