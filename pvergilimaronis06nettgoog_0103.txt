THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xcix

the historiam oi Latin literature to he the Haterianus who is quoted
as an authority by Trebellius Pollio in his history oi the thirty tytanis
(Script. Hist. Aug. XXX. Tyr. 6. 5), in which case he must belong
to the last part oi the third century an.

Macrobius (l. c.) quotes Haterianus as his authority for saying that
the poet and orator Calvus used deae as a feminino noun; a usage
which he illustratas also from Virgil and Sallust. The same instances
from Virgil and Sallust are given in a note in Donatus on Terence
Eun. 5. 2. 363 it may therefore he that Haterianus and Donatus are
both drawing ou an older source. The other remarks attributed to
Haterianus do not give ahigh idea oi his capacity3 ag. his proposal
ou A. 10. 242 (“ quem dedit ipse Invictum Ignipotens '’) to read iqui
for epse, and construet it with inuictam, “ uuoonquerablo by fire.'’

THE VERONA SOHOLIA.

These scholia, written on the margin of the Verona palimpsest, are
mentioned here on account of a quality which, as it immensely
enhances their valuo, seems tc me also to have some bearing upon
their date. Iallpde to the fact that in the Verona scholia, far more
thau in the commentarios oi Philargyrins and Servius, the names are
g'ven of the scholare from whose works the notes are derived. The
names ol Cornutus, Asper, Velius Longus, Terentius Scaurus, Sulpicius
Apollinaris, und Haterianus are mentioned har ostensu iu proportion
to the extent of the remaining fragments oi these scholia, than in the
later commentarios. This phenomenon seems to me to indicate that
they are older than the time of Servius and Philargyrius, whose
characteristic it is, ou the whole, to say little or nothing of their
authorities. Iam inclined to attribute this not so much to deliberate
intention on their part, as to the lact that in course of time the names
of the older scholare who had originally gethered the stores oi Virgilian
learning gradually vanished from the commentarios Philargyrius
and Servius may have used as their immediate sources of informatiou
not the ancient commentarios themselves, but comperietis or haudbooks
compiled from them. Nothing ou the other haud strikes the reader so
much in the fragments which romain of tho Verona scholia as their
air oi genuine antiquity, their clearness, fulness, aud sanity of view
Even in their fragmentary condition they embody a great deal of
valuablo information, evidently drawn from very good sources, on
points oi grammar aud lexicography. To take a single instance: the
lexicogmphical notos on urnac, coac, orus, ultus, insignis, at tho be·
ginning oi the commentar-y on the Aeneid, are iar fuller than the
corresponding notes in Servius, aud that ou insignis fuller even than
