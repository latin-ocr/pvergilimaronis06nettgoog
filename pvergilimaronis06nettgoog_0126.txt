most of its circumstances, the compliments which shepherd pays to
shepherd, and the exchange of presente, are all modelled more or less
closely after the Dorio prototypo. Corydon and Thyrsis are perhaps
more original: yet even they owe something to Menalcas aud Daphnis,
es well as tc one cr two other Sicilian shepherds, not only in the
antecedente, but in the contenta of their scngs; and the eminence tc
which Corydon is lifted by his success is similar, though inferior, to
that attained by Daphnis. The dying Damon, or rather the lover
whom Damon personatos, recalls in the first part ot his complaint the
dying Daphnis, in the last the slighted Polyphemus: the enchantress
who is represented by Alphesiboeus is the same who in the second Idyl
employa even more charms to bring back Delphis, though the success
which this time crowns her efforts is new. Moeris and his companicn,

like Meliboeus and Tityrus, talk about a subject which, being part cf

Virgil’s personal history, could not but be his own: yet even they
supply ns with reminiscences from Sicily, partly in the things which
they say to each other, partly in their quotaticns from the poet's un·
published verses. The dying Daphnis reappears cncc more in the
dying or despairing Gallus: the complaint oi the lover is indeed his
own, but the circumstances which surrcnnd him are copied minutely
irem that song which Thyrsis, the sweet songster from Aetna, sang tc

the goatherd in the hot noon under the elna Even this enumeration
must fail to give any noticn of the numberless instances ot incidental
imitation, sometimes in a single line, sometimes in the mere turn of
an expression, which fill up as it were the broader outlines of the copy.
And yet there cau be no doubt that Virgil ranked as an original poet
in his own judgment no less than in that of his contemporaries, and
theton the strength of those very appropriatione which would stamp
a modern author with the charge ci plagiarism. His Thalia, he
prcudly reminds us, was the first who deigned to disport herself in
the strains of Syracuse, as that was her first employment. And in ’
the ninth Eclogue, where he grieves by anticipation, tenderly and
gracefully enough, over the loss which the pastoral world would have
sustained had he died prematnrely, of the four fragments of his
poetry which are singled out ior admiration two are copies from
Theocritus, and one ci them, the first, sc close a copy, and so slight,
not to say trivial, in itself, that it ean hardly have been instanced with
any other view than to remind the reader of his success in borrowing
and slrilfully reproducing. Itis, in fact, an intimation, made almost in
express words, that he wished tc bc considered as the Roman Theocritus.

The impressicn leit by such passages on the mind ci aconeiderate
reader is very much that which a modern author, writing without the
restraint oi verse, would seek to produce by a quotation or a direct re·
