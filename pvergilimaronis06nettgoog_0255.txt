INTRODUCTION. 135

gathers itself, ports of it, it is trne, being connected with him some·
whst loosely, but never absolutely detaching themselves from him.
Hesiod invokes the Muses, but it is 11111 they may tell him of Zeus,
aud induce the great Father to see thet human justice is rightly

awarded, while he himself speaks to Perses the words of trnth Perses

· is no Maecenas, who, though he may have suggested the subject of the

song, is addressed in it merely os 1 sort of ideal render: he 111 wrong·
doer in whose mind 1 change has te be wrought, for his own sake ond
for the sulse of others, and legend, fable, and preceptum employed by
turns to bring him to 1 sense of past miscenduct and present duty.
The subject is introduced, 11 11 were, by 1 fresh leaf out cf the Theo·
gony, in which, however, the mythologiccl elemeut is subordinated to
the 1110111, 1 description of two goddesses of striis, whom we may dis·
tinguish in modern language as Discord and Emnlation, the first the
source of wnr and misery, the second of hononrablo endeavour. = But
the morel is for Perses, who is worned not to waste time which 1 busy
man can ill spere on the false 111111, forensis wrongling, butte have
the question of his own and his brother's inheritance settled by im-
portial arbiters, not, 11 11 the 1111 trial of the suit, by judgee whom he
had bribed. For him, too, is told the legend of Prometheus and Zeus,
showing how Pondere first brought evil among mankind, who hed lived
till then untrouhled by hurd teil and grievous siclmess, und concluding
thence that there is no way of escape from the eye of Zeus. That tale
being over, Perses is asked if he will hear another, and bidden to lay
it up deep in his heart. Then follows the narrative of the five ages, in
the 1111 of which men are now living, an evil time, when father shall
be at variance with child, guest with host, friend with friend, aud
brother with brother3 when justice and conscience shall not be found
in the hands of men, but the base shall supplent the more noble, speak-
ing orooked words, und shall sweur 1 false 01111. One more tale is
told, 1 very briei one, addressed 10 kings and judges of the earth. It
consists simply of a reply by 1 hawk to 1 nightingale struggling in his
tolons, and appealing for mercy, 1 reply which amounts to no more
thau that she is absolutely 11 his disposal ond had better not resist;
the intention donbtless being 10 put the case of oppression in all its
noked repulsiveness, that 1111111111 pervertens of justice may understand
and pause in their wrongful course. Pessing from fable to 1 more
direct modeof appeel, he again exhorta both Perses and 1111 jndges.
The former is bidden to “look on this picture end on this;” on the
flonrishing city of the just, where there are peace and festal doiugs,
where the oels carries ncorus 11 its top and honey 11 its core, where the
children resemble their parents, and none go on shipboard, 101111111
produces fruit enough; ond on the unjust ration, which is everwasted
