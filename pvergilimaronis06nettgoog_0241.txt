THE LATER BUCOLIC POETS OF ROME.

——

Ie bucolic poetry found no cultivators at Rome before the time of
Virgil, it does not seem to have enjoyed much more popularity after-
wards. Wernsdorf (Poetae Latini Minores, vol. 2, prael. pp. vi, vii),
who wonders that it should not have fiourished more among a people
originally sprung from shepherds and preserving the recollection of
their origin by annual festivals, and inclines to lay the blame ou the
luxurians temper oi the great city, as being naturally antagonistio to a
teste for rustic simplicity, is sufficiently explicit in his testimony to
the fect, stating that no trace cau be discovered oi the existence of any
bucolic writer after Virgil earlier thau Calpurnius, while the pastoral

poets of a later period, with the exception of Nemesianus, who, in his -

view, as we shall see, is net really oue ot them, are inelegant aud hardly
worth repriuting. Calpurnius and Nemesianus themselves cannot be
said to stand high in the list of postAugnstan anthors; but as they
happen to fall within the classical periodas commonly understood, aud
conform more closely than their successore to the Theocritean or Vir-
giliau type in the treatment ot their subject, perhaps a briei account ot
them may not be unacceptable.

At the ontset we are met by a critical question, affecting the author·
ship of the works which bear their name. These amount jointly to
eleven pastorale, most of them averaging less than oue hundred lines
All of them were assigned by the five first editions, following the ma·
y'ority of the MSS, to a single writer, Τ. (or, as the first edition gives
it, after one MS, C.) Calpurnius Siculus. The sixth edition, ‘impres-
sum Parmae per Angelis Ugoletr'r,' without a date, but referred by
Ulitius to the year 1500, made a division of the authorship, attributing
the seven first pastorals' to Calpurnius, the remaining four to [M. Aure-
lius Olympins] Nemesianus, ou the authority of a ‘most ancient and
correct’ MS. from Germauy belonging to Thadaens Ugoletus. It also
prefixed a title to the bucolica of Calpurnius, inscribing them to this
same Nemesianus. This arrangement seems to have been followed
almost unhesitatingly by subseqnent editors till the time of Jauus
Ulitius, who, in his ‘Venatio N ovantiqna’ (Elzevin 1645, an edition oi
the didactic writers on hunting, together with the pastorale of Calpur·
