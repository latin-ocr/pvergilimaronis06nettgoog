148 GEORGICA.

aspect in which the advantage is not on the side 01 Virgil. One great
reason why Lucretius is found 10 be unreadableis his enthusiasm 101
his subject. Whether he thoroughly understood the Epicurean system
is, Ι believe, doubted by some 01 those who have most right to raise the
question: but no one will say that he did not embrace it with all the
burning encrgy 01 deep conviction. Admitting the uncongeniality of
his subject to latin verse and its distastefulness to the vulgar, he has
good hope that he shall be able to make it palatable to his friend: hut
he does not avoid philosophical detail 101 188101 being thought tedicus
or repulsive. If Memmius is weary, the remedy, he tells him, is not 10
hear less, but to hear more.

“ Quod ei pigraris paulumve 1808888118811 rs,
Hoc tibi de plano possum promittere, Memmi;
Usque adeo largos haustus e fontibu' maguis
Lingua meo suavis diti de pectore fundet,

Ut verear ne tarda prius per membra senectus
8811181, 81 111 nobis vitai claustra resolvat,
Quam tibi de quavis una re versibus omnis

Virgil 18 equally consciens 01 8 difficulty, though the manner iu which
he expresses it, while partielly horrowed 110111 another passage in Lucre·
tius, is characteristically different.⁸ ι“],10111118811,” 118 says, “I too am
well assured how hard the struggle will be 101 language to plant her
standard here, and invest a theme so slender with her own peculiar
glory: but there is a rapturous charm that whirls me along over Par·
nassns' lonely steeps3 a joy in surmounting heights where no former
wheal 1188 worn a way, no easy slope leads down to the Castalian spring.”
“Angustus hunc addere rebus honorem: ’' such is the object which he
proposes 10 himself: and the way in which he attains it is by keeping
011101 sight the more prosaic parts 01 his subject, substituting poetical
ornament, as Ι have said elsewhere, for logical sequence, 8111100118-
quently preferring ambiguity to tedicus repetition. He had 10 0110088

But the question oi the reality 01 the Georgics does not wholly de·
pend 011 the velue 01 the work as 811 agricultural treatise. It may be
true that Virgil is an inaccurate farmer's guido, yet true, also, 11181 he
is 8 warm end hearty lover 01 nature. This is a praise which is usually
conceded tc the Georgius without hesitation. Horace said that Virgil
