ON'SOME OF THE EARLY ORITIOISMS OF
VIRGIL'S POETRY.

Ι Tm Virgil was attaeked during his life-time for his innovationis in

style we are assured by express statements in the memoir by Suetonius.
After his death Carvilius Pictor published an Aeaeidomcstic, on the
analogy of the Homeromastia of Zoilus, and the Ciceromastix mentioned
at the beginning of the serenth hook of Aulus Gellius3 Herennius col-
lected his odia, which Ι suppose means fanlts of expression, Perellius
Faustus his plagiarisms (furtu) ; while an apparently nentral work,
called ὁμοιότητες, οι· a collection of his translations from the Greek, by
Octavius Avitus, filled eight books.

A reply to the obtrectatores Vergilii was written by Asconirm Pedianus ;
u fact which may throw some light on the date of the works mentioned
by Suetonius. For Asconius lived in the first part of the first century
ann and if, as it is reasonable from the language of Suetonius to

infer, his work was a reply to the three books oi Carvilius Pictor,
Herennius, and Perellius Faustus, it follows that those works cannot

heve been published at any very great distance of time from Virgil’s
death, which took place in 19 nc.

I propose to ask whether it is possible to truce any remains of these
criticisms, and the replies to them, in the notes of Servius1 and
Macrobius, or elsewhere.

And first as to criticisms passed upon Virgil for new combinatione
of words. Agrippa said thet Virgil bad been suborned by Maecenas
to invent a new kind of affectation (κακοζηλία), which consisted in au
unusual employment of ordinary words,² and was therefore difficult
of detection. With thia criticism I arn strongly inclined to connect
a passage in Horace’s Ars Poeticc (aab foll), a work which, as Michaelis⁸

addition, the stt-called Vulgate or uninterpolated text of Servius is meant. By
Servius (Dan), on the other hand, is mount the Servius edited by Peter Daniel, and
containing the additional notes printed by Thilo (in his recent edition) in italica.
The relation of these notes to those of tha Vulgata is discusssd below in the sectiou
on Servius. .
