146 GEORGIOA.

Lucretius himself talks 61 Epicurus, Empedocles, and Anaxagoras. I
mean those celebrated lines towards the close of the Second Book,⁶
where the poet prays first 61 611 1161 116 charming Muses, whose
minister he is for the great love that hae amitten him, would admit
him 61 11611 company, and teach him the courses of the 61616 16 heaven,
the various eclipses 61 116 666, aud the agonies 61 116 moon, whence
come quakings of the earth, what is the force by which the deep seas
61161116 the bursting 61 their barriers and settle down again ou them-
selves, why the winter 6666 make such 16616 16 dip 16 ocean, or what
is the retardiug 66666 which makes the nights move slowly 3—and then,
after advertiug 16 116 16161161 plessures 616 country life, commemoratas
the happiness of the men 1116166 gained a knowledge 61 116 censes of
things, aud so trampled 6611611661611 1611166611 fate’s relentless decree,
aud the 1661 61 insatiata Acheron. It is in Lucretius' poem thet
eclipses, earthquakes, end the varying lengths 61 days in winter 6611
summer, 616 discnssed aud accounted tor: it 16 Lucretius himself who
dilates on the 16611116 116166 disclosed 16 116 16116161 61 the Epicuroen
system, when the terrers 61 116 mind 1166 away, and the walls of the
universe part asuuder, and the 1611661666 61 the gods appear iu calm,
unclouded light, bnt the realms 61 Acheron are no more 6666 Β6611166
1116 direct recognition, the number of imitations of Lucretius contained
in the Georgica is very great. Even Forbiger, who had edited 116·
6161166 before he undertook Virgil, though he hes gethered 6 copious
harvest, has 1611 some 161 6 666661 render tc glean: 6611 Ι cannot doubt
thatun attentive student 61 Lucretius, who could perceive 1666 obvious
resemblances, would be able to collect many more. The invocation of
Venusia perhaps ratberto be contrasted than compared with the 1116161
61111166666 16 116 different rural gods which open the 11161 Book of the
Georgios, 161 11 666166 161616 supplied a hint 161 116 1616661166 61
Bacchus which stands 61 116 head 61 116 Second, while Memmius,
allowsnce being 66116161 the greater diffuseness in which Lucretius
throughout indulges, stands in nearly the sanie relation to the one poem
66 Maecenas to the other. The narrative 61 116 plagae 61 Athens, with
which Lucretius concludes his poem was obviously the model of the
account of the pestilence iu Northern Italy 611116 end of Virgil's Third
Book. Nor, while we remark 6 general similarity in the structure of
the paragraphs 16 111161 116 strictly diductio portion of the two poeuis
is contained, need we pass over the fect that Virgil 16 indebted to
Lucretius 161661616161 116 formulae with which he introduces these
divisione 61 116 subject-for the‘Principio,’ for the ‘ Praeterea,’ for the
‘Nunc aga’ for the ‘ Quod superest,' 6611161 the ‘Contemplator’
