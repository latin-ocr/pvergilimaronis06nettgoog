THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. xcvii

URBANUS.
Iam not convinced by Ribbeck's argument (Prol. p. 167) from the

mention oi Urbanus in Servius' note on Α. 5. 517, that this com·
mentator was prior iu time to Velius Longus. Longus, we have seen,
made some remarks in answer to a criticism of Cornutus on Virgil’s
alleged mistake in making Aenms devote to death a pigeon, the bird
of Venus: and it seems that Urbanus had a note to the seme purpose.
But it would be rash, surely, to infer from this that longus was
iudebted to Urbanus.

On two grounds I am disposed to think that too early a date has
been assigned to Urbanus, First, there is not, so far as I am aware,
any mention of himin the Verona scholia. It may be auswered that
the Verona scholia as we hare them are merely a fragment, and that
we cannot therefore be justified in arguiug from their silence. True:
yet even in their fragmentary condition they preserve quotations
from a great number of commentatore, Asper, Cornutus, Haterianus,
Longus, Nisus, Probus, Terentius Scaurus, Sulpicius Apollinaris; and
it would be strange, had the compiler ot these scholia known of a
commentary by Urbanus, that no mention oi it should have survived
even in a fragment oi his work.

Secondly, the absurdity oi the notes attributed to Urbanus seems to
me to stamp them as belonging to a later age than that of Trajan or
the Antoninos. 'Po takes single instance: in A. 4. 469, “Eumenidum
veluti demens videt agmina Pentheus,'’ Urbanus seems to have taken
“ agmina ’' as meaning the eoils of the Furies' serpente. Itis easy to
imagine how Probus would have dealt with such a remark: or again
with theton A. 4. 624, ‘⁴ nullus amor populis, nec foedera sunto,”
where Urbanus observed that Virgil had used a legal word, nmio,
“propter odia hereditaria.''

censeamus VINDEX, TERENTIUS SOAURUS,
SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS.

Caesellius Vindex, the compiler of a lexicographicel work iu fifty
books entitled Lectiones autiquae, arranged in alphabeticel order,
is quoted by Gellius, 2. 16. 5, as giving a seusible explanation of
portanto proles in the sixth Aeneid. He took postremae to mean not
“ post patris mortem natus,’' hut “postremo loco natns,'’ an iuterpreta-
tion for which he was taken to task by Sulpicius Apollinaris. Itis
easy to conjecture, though there is no positive proot of the fact, that
the work of Caesellius Vindex may have been used to a far greater
