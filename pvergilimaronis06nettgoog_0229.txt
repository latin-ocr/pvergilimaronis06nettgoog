BUOOLIOA. EOL. IX. 109

commentary attributed to Probus, which in this pert seems to be moed on the sams
souroes of information as the biography 1)] Suetonius, informs us thot Virgil had his
estate restored on being introduced to Octavianus by Cornelius Gallus: that tha
veterane were so irritated at this that the poet was nearly killed by the primipilaris
Milionius Toro; that the Eclogues were not published in the order in which they were
written, for the ninth,a complaint of injury, ought to be plsoed before the first, which
is an expression of gratitudo for the redress of the injury. Thus Probus, or the oom-
piler of the commentary attributed to him, regarded the first Eologue as referring
io the final restoration of Virgil to his estate, subsequent to the act of violence of which
complaint is made in the ninth

But Servius, in his commentsry on the first Ealogue, says, in explaining tha
relation of the ninth Eologue ιο the first, thot, after the first Eelogue was written,
virgil went bank to his estate, was then almost killed (not 1)] Milienius Tora bnt)
1)] one Arrius, saved himself by leaping into the Minoi0,and afterwards had his estete
again restored by Octavianus. Servius places the ninth Eulogue afim the first, and
so do ‘⁴ others '’ (olii) whom he quotes, who however give quite a different account of
the transaction. According to them Virgil, after obtaining immunitos omarum from
Οοιονιοοοε, fell into a disputo witha neighbour about his boonduries; aman named

* clodius threatened to hill him, and pursued him with a drawn swerd, but virgil

escaped into a charmel-burner’s shop.

I doubt whether it is worth while attempting‚ as Ribbeck does in his Proloponwoa,
to weave these different accounts into a consistent whole. It is clear thetae is
natural in such a ease, different versione of the transaction must have existed in tha
time of Servius, and very probably much earlier. The main question, however, is,
what does the best evidence, that of the Eologues themselves, warrant us in infarring?
The commentatore were evidently somewhat pnzuled 1)] thefsot of theninth Eclogue
coming after the first. The difficulty is noticsd by Probus, who wooonts for it in
a rational way: bnt 1 suspect that Servius and the authorities whom he quotes
were misled by the order in which the Eelognes standand arranged the facts so as ιο
pot the ninth chronologioolly subsequent to the first. 1 believe that Pnobus (if it be
Probus) was right in supposing the ninth to hove been the earliest, and the first to
refer to the linai restoration of Virgil’s estate. This supposition is not contradieted
1)] the mention of Varus in the ninth Eclogue, supposiog him, as we must suppose,
ιο be the Alfenus Varus who had succeeded Pollio in Cisalpine Gaul. For Suetonius
expressly says that it was this Varus, with Asinius Pollio and Gallus, whose influenee
seoured ιο Virgil the possession oi his estate. In other words, the entreaties addressed
ιο Varus in the ninth Eclogue were successful, Varus not earing ιο pursue his
. politioal differenoes with Pollio so far as to injure Pollio’s friend.

1 doubt theu whether the evidence afforded 1)] the Eelogues themselves and 1)] tha
biography of Suetonius (and the other evidence we have seen to be confused and in-
consistent) nements our assuming more than this: that Virgil was ejected with
violence and at the peril of his life from his formaster having been under the
impression that he was to keep it; that iu his trouble he was assisted 1)] Maecenas
(Suetonius, ξ 20); that he addressed Alfenus Varus on the subject in the ninth
Eologue, and probably also in plain prose; that he then went toBome, where, backed
1)] the influenoe of Pollio, Verus, aud Gallus (to whom the eighth, ninth, and tenth
Fologues are respectively dedicated), he obtained from Ootovims the restoration of
his estate-H. N.]
