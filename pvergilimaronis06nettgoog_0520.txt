400 P. VERGILI MARON IS

Effusus labor, atque immitis rupta tyranni

Foedera, terque fragor stagnis auditus Avernis.

Illa, Quis et me, inquit, miseram, et te perdidit, Orpheo,
Quis tantus furor? En iterum crudelia retro 415
Fata vocant, conditque natantia lumina somnus.

Iamque vale: feror ingenti circumdata nocte,
Invalidasque tibi tendens, heu non tua, palmas!

Dixit, 11 ex oeulis subito, eeu fumus in auras
Commixtus tenuis, fugit diversa, neque illum, 500
