154 GEORGIGA.

the plenting ie 10 be thoreugh, the clothing entire: eud the rewerd
is 10 be found in the work itself-thet the wine-god should be
pmpegebed by humen aid-thet the wearing 01 00 wast a robe

task is to instruct 1110 lebourer in hie manifold duties, and record his
menifold triumphe. He hes leunched his bark, and must perform 1110
voyage3 and he cells on his patron to stand et his eide, and spread with
him the flying soil over 11110 broad ocean. Aguin aud again in the
book we 000 glimpsee of the same unflinehing resolution:

“ terrem multo ante memento
11000010το, 01 magnos scrobibus 0000ίά0νο 11011103*

“Seminibus positis, superest diducere terrem
Saepius ad cupite, et duros iactare bidentis,
Aut presso 00010010 solum sub vomere, 01 ipso
11001010 lactentis teter 010010 10000000.”

'Phe bullocks may be 1001111 : the turne may be ehorp end awkwerd 1 but
the work is to be done. So when he pessos from the vine, the olive,
aud the epple audite eognetes, to 1000 favoured trees, 110 eeeks 10 sheme
the reluctant husbandmen into s sense 01 his duty. “ Ι epeek 01 fruit

the Third Book Ι uoed only refer 10 the passage which Ι instanced in a
preceding paragraph—thet where he telke of the orduone nature of the
work to which hahes bound himself, aud the joy which for that very
reason attende it. Ae before, he mentione 1110 own lebenrs in connexion
