xcvi THE AN OIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

and tho Verona scholia, and much probably has found its way into the
commentary of Servius. For we find in several instances that where
the Verona scholia quote Longus by name, the same note is given in
Servius in au abridged form and without any mention 01 him: a
phanomonou which must never be lost sight of in considering the
question 01 the sources 01 the Serv-ian commentary, whether the con·
clusion be that Servius is borrowing from Longus, or that the notes of
both are derived from the same source. The priucipal notes of Longus
preserved by the Verona scholia are:

(a) A. 3. 693 on the name Plemmyrium, which he (or his authori·
ties) derived from πλημύρειν “ideo quud undique fluctibus nudisque
adluatur.'’ This or a similar note is abridged in Servius without
acknowledgment.

(b) A. 3: 705 on palmosa 80111111111101111010 being explained after
Melissus (l) as meaning “the mother of many victore in the Olympia

mesa„

88(1) A. 4. 149. Longus derived aequis from siae 19111, and explained
it as :deformia which again he took as coming from de aud formas,
hot: and so Servius, again without acknowledgment of the source 01
his note. So Nonius, p. 33.

(d) A. 5. 488. Iiougus replied to a carping criticism of Cornutus
on this line. Again Servius gives the gist of this note without
mention of his authority.

(c) A. 7. 489 on the word ferm for a stag. This note of Longus
seems to be based on the same sources as that of Nonius p. 307, both
quoting A. 2. 52, where seras is used 01 a horse. Again Servius
abridges this or a similar note without acknowledgment.

. (f) A. 10.1. Longus here had avaluable note on the words domm
Olympi, iu illustration cf which he quoted cenaculum caeli from Ennius.

(9) A. 10. 551. Longus menti ns and solves a difficulty about
Faunus: how could he be mortal 11 ru 01 anymph? The question
is also raised and solved by Servius. The gist of both notes is the
same, but they are evidently independent, and probably derived from
a common source.

(l.) A. 10. 557. Longus illustrated the local adverb istic by two
passages from the 1111111111εοί Plautus.

(i) Iu A. 10. 245 it seems that Longus read spectabis for spectabit,
saying that the word 00110111 should be supplied after crastiua lac.
Macrobius 3. 6. 6 has a nota ol Longus on A. 3. 84, which is also
given, without any aokuowledgment of its source, in the Caesel addi-
tiens to Servius on the passage.
