DIDACTIO POETS ΟΡ ROME. 417

exordium violently separated from its context, about the calamitcus iate
ot the old mythological rece who ventured unassisted tc combat with
wild heusta Returniug to details, he speaks of the plumage required
for the formido, oi neoses aud spriuges, aud takes occasion to extol one

Dercylos the Arcadian, a name unknown to mythographers, as having
earned by his piety the honour of being the inventor not only oi the
springs, bnt of the hunting-spear. After a discussion about tbe best
shatts for huntingspcars, be lanuches into abolder strain, and enlarges

for 350 lines ou the varicus breeds of dogs, especially the metagou, a
crosa between the Spartan and Cretan, introduced by Hagnon, another
unknown worthy, ou the care which the metagon requires when young,
aud on tbe diseams and iujurias incident to dogs, and their remedies,
ending with a description of a solemn ceremonial in Sicily, where dis·
eaaed animala and their keepers are auointed with oil from a natural
spring iu a cavern sacred to Vulcan, and a companiou picture of a yearly
lustration of houuds and huuting implemeuts iu the grove of the Arician
Diana. 'Phe remeiuder oi the poem, only 40 lines, is occupied with au
enumerationes tbe best breeds oi horsea, the preference being appa-
rently given to the Italian,⁸ in e passage which in its completed form
may bave been intended, asWernsdori thinks, as the actual conclusion
oi the work, though both symmetry oi composition and the claims oi
the subject might certainly have pleeded ior a more extended treet
· ment.

The following passage, on the early training of the metagon, will, I
think, give a fair notion oi Gratius, both in his strength and in his weak·
ness. The early part contains nice observatiou, pleasiugly expressed,
though the language sometimes iails in perspicuity; the latter shows
how easily he can fall into tasteless common-place.

“Tum deinde monebo,
Ne matrem indocilis natorum turba fatiget,
Percensere notis, iamque inde excernere parvos
Signa dabunt ipsi. Teneris vix artubm haeret
Ille tuos olim non defecturus bonores:
Iamque illum impatiens aequae vementis sortis
Extulit: adlwtat materna regna sub alvo,
Ubera tota tenet, e tergo liber aperto,⁹

⁸ 'l'be sense however ot the lines in which the Italian breed is mentioned, the last
three ot the poem, is very doubtful, as several words bave been obliterated.

· Burmann conjectures ‘⁴ Ubera tota teneus, ao tergo liber aperto.” Gronovius
changes ‘⁴ a ” (which seems to be merely a correction of the MS. reading “ ω’) into
“ stat.'' He is followed by Haupt, who published e critical edltiou ol Gratius aud
Nemesianus, with the hagment of the Heluetico, at Ieipsio, in 1838. The sense is
that this promising whelp monopolixes his mother's teat, and will not let any of his
brothers get on his back, except in oold westher, when be is more tolerput.
