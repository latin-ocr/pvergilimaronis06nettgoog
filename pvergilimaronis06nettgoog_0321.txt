GEORGIOON LIB. Ι. 201

(lum medio celeres revolant ex aequore mergi
Clamoremque ferunt ad litora, cumque marinae

In sicco ludunt fulicae, notasque paludis

Deserit atque altam supra volat ardea nubem.

Saepe etiam stellas, vento inpendente, videbis sss
Praecipites caelo labi, noctisque per umbram
Flammarum longos a tergo albescere tractus;

Saepe levem paleam et frondes volitare caducas,

Aut summa nantis in aqua colludere plumas.

At Boreae de parte trucis cum fulminat, etcum 370
Eurique Zephyrique tonat domus, omnia plenis

Rura natant fossis, atque omnis navita ponto

Umida vela legit. Numquam inprudentibus imber
Obiuit: aut illum surgentem vallibus imis
