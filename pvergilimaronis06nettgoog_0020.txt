xvi PREFACE TO ΤΗΕ SECOND EDITION.

poets, Weber's “Corpus Poetarum ; ” for the fragments of the χ

Latin dramatista Ribbeck ; for those of Ennius, Vahlen ; for those
of Lucilius, Gerlach3 for Cicero, mostly Verburg3 for the Scrip-
tores Rei Rusticae, sometimes Gesner, sometimes Schneider; for

the Latin grammarians, Keil; for Festus, Miiller3 for Nonius, ¹
generally Gerlach and Roth. This list is perhaps not quite ἲ
complete, butI think it contains nearly all those authors the ²

references ιο which are likely to vary according to the editions
used. Ι fear there may be some cases found in which Ι have
used an edition not named in it; but the notes have been written

at various places, a large portion of them indeed during vacations,

when Ι have been absent from Oxford, and have in consequence
only bad a certain number of my own boolrs about me.

ln concluding the Preface to my first edition, Ι spoke of my
obligations to Mr. Long and his lamented colleague. To their
supervision were due the removal of many errors, and the acces·

sion of some new information. At tha seme time Ι said that their ξ
criticisms had very considerably abated the confidence with which 1

Ioffered the volume to the public: and though the favourable

opinion of most of my reviewers, and the sale of a large impres· ¹

sion, seem ιο show that the work has in tha main been approved,
Ihave learned quite enough, both from my own increased ex-
periencc and from the observations of others, to prevent me from
withdrawing the expression of selfdistrust Where sc much has
been successfully- questioned, it is impossible not to be afraid that
there remains behind much more, not only open ιο disputabat
actually erroneous. Ι can only say, as before, that I shall be

very grateful to any reader who will help me towards accuracy by ἵ

pointing out my mistalres. Meantime,I may perhaps put in a χ
plea for indulgence on account of the wide field over which the ,

notes extend. A body of several thousands of propositione on a ¹

great variety of subjecta can hardly fail to yield a large per·
contage of error.
