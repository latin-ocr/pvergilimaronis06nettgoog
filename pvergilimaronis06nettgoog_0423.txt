GEORGIOON LIB. ΙΙΙ. 303

Pascua, post montem oppositum, et trans flumina lata,
Aut intus clausos satura ad praesepia servant.

Carpit enim vires paulatim uritque videndo 215
Femina, nec nemorum patitur meminisse neo herbae,

Dulcibus illa quidem inlecebris, et saepe superbos
Cornibus inter se subigit decernere amantia

Pascitur in magna Sila formosa iuvenca:

llli alternantes multa vi proelia miscent aaa
Vulneribus crebris 3 lavit ater corpora sangnis,

Versaque in obnixos urgentur cornua vasto

(lum gemitu; reboant silvaeque et longus Olympus.
