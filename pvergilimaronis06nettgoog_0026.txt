xxii · LIFE OF VIRCIL.

Varius may have inspired Virgil with the love 61 cpic and tragedy.

N It is curicus that before he began the Eclogues 116 attempted a poem

on Roman history, but found the subject uncongenial to his then

The Ciceronian age, barren 61 epic, tragedy, and comedy, had pro·
duccd only lyris, didactic, and learned poetry. Virgil’s youth was
passed under the direct influence 61 the Alexandrian school and its
followers in Italy; with Cornelius Gallus, 66661 the most distinguished

among the “cantores Euphorionis,’' he was on ternis of intimate
friendship.² It is remarkable how Virgil’s genius and tact enabled
him to avoid the characteristic 16611661 the Alexandriana and their
imitators. 1116111116 1666116166 ficto Atque per umbayes 6116696 scursa
1666116. Their merite he makes his own, their refinement and their
beauty; but there is nothing to show that he had ever any taste 161·
the obscurity and affectation and love 61 recondite mythology which

Catullus and Propertius and probably Cinna allowed to blemish much
of their waiting.

Before the year 41 66, Virgil had been fortunate enough 16 win the
friendship of Asinius PolliO,8 whom be mentions in the third Eulogne
66 encouraging his attempta in the way of pastoral poetry, 66 well as
that of Cornelius Gallus and Alienus Varus. Pollio was loqutus in
Galba Cisalpina in 43 6.6.; whether Virgil knew him before thiais
not certain. When the troubles oi the year 41 came, and Virgil, like
Propertius and Tibullus, was ejected from his estate, the 16166666 of
these three friends procured its 166111611611166610616616666,6611616661
it a hard task to silence the complaints oi 1116 ejected landowners,
without giving dangerous offensa to his veterane.⁴ ’

16 the quarrcl which attended Virgil's expulsion from his farm hs
was aided by the weslthy and accomplished Etruscan eques, C. Cilnius
Maecenas, with whom he bad previously been acquainted, 661 was
afterwards on terme of intimate friendship.⁶ The Eolognes, published
probably in 37 ao. or 1116166116616,1 were intended, says Suetonius, as 6
