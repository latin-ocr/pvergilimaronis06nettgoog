218 · P. vunnim, MARONIS ’

Principio arboribus varia est natura creandis.
Namque aliae, nullis hominum cogentibus, ipsae ιο
Sponte sua veniunt camposque et flumina late
Curva tenent, ut molle siler, lentaeque genistae,
Populus et glauca canentia ironde salicta3
Pars autem posito surgunt de semine, ut ¹atltae
