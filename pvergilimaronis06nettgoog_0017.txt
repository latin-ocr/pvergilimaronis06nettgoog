ΤΟ THE SEOOND EDITION. xiii

without holding myself bound by his judgment. The more im·
portant varieties Ι have mentioned in the notes, particulariaing
the MSS. in which they are found, and noticing even transcrip-
tural erroro when they seemed to suggest any critical considera·
tiens. Doubtlcss the text of Virgil cannot yet be said to be fixed:
but it is satisfactory to know that so much has been added to our
materiale for fixing it Meantime it may be asserted eren with
more confidence than before that there are few writers whose text
isin sc satisfactory a state as Virgil’s. Variations there are, and
probably will continue to be, as some of the most eminent of the
ancient grammariaus appear to have made independent recensione,
each of which would naturally have distinctiva peculiarities. But
the choica generally lies between words, each of which has con·
siderable probability, extemal and intemal; and though the critic
may not always feel sure that he has before him the actual hand
of Virgil, he is not left to the hopeless confusion which unskilful
transcribere have introduced into the text of other authors 'l'he
more important MSS, though not always accurate representatires
eren of their own recension, supply each other's defects: the less
important may in general be passed over entirely. The need of
critical conjecture is almost wholly removed. Even the two
instances where, in the first edition, following other editors, Ι
had disturbed the text without any external authority, hare now
disappeared. In Eclogue 7, r. 54, Lachmann and Madvig have
shown “ quaequo'' to be the true reading: in Eclogue 8, though
there is no authority for leaving out the burden contained in v.
7 6, there is authority for introducing a correspondiug burden after
w. 28, which I hare accordingly done.

Iu the notes I hare arailed myself largely of tha labeum of my
predecessore. Servius and Philargyrius I have used constautly,
though it is likely that some few of their remarks may have
escaped me‚⁴ as I hare studied them chiefly in the commentary
attached to the Delphin aud Variorum Classica where they seem
not to hare been reprinted quite entire. 'l'he same collection has
supplied me with many of the notes of Germanus, Cerdo, Teub-
maun, Emmeuessius, and others This field had been partially
