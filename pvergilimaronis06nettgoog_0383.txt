GEORGICON LIB. ΙΙ. 263

Frigidus et silvis aquilo decussit honorem,

Iam tum acer curas venientem extendit in annum sot
Rusticus et curvo Saturni dente relictam

Persequitur vitem attondens fingitque putando.

Primus humum fodito, primus devecta cremato
Sarmenta, et vallos primus sub tecta refert03

Postremus metito. Bis vitibus ingruit umbra; slo
Bis segetem dcusis obducunt sentibus herbue;

Durus uterque labor: laudato ingentia rura,
