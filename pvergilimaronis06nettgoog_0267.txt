IN TRODUOTION. 147

'I'o inquire into the points 81 dissimilarity between the De Rerum
Natura and tha Georgica is virtually to inquire into the causes which
have made the latter uniformly popular, while the former has been com-
paratively neglectcd. The answcr is not to he found in the difference
of their subjecta. The materialism of Lucretius is cold and cheerless
enough: bnt the details of ploughing aud fallowing, 81 budding trees
and training vines, of fattening bulla and curing sick sheep, are not in
themselves more inviting‚ at least 18 88 unprofcssional render. Nor can
it he said that Lucretius fails, where such writers 88 Aratus and
Nicander fail, from inferiority in poetical power. The invocation te
Venus, the picture 81 118 old age oi the world, the expostulationes
nature with the mortal who repines athis mortality, the pertrait of the
aessens aud their attendants, and other passages that might be named,
appeal to the imaginatiou perhaps more strongly than any thing which
can be adduced from the Georgica. But it is the artistic part of poetry
-that which I have attempted to characterize in the Introduction to
the Eclogues-which has the most enduring charm for the generality
81 readers ε aud thersitis that Lucretius falls short and Virgil succeeds.
Lucretius wrote before the modulatiou 81 118 18118 hexameter was
thoroughly understood, before 118 strength aud weakness 81 118 Iatiu
language, ‘quid possit oriri, quid nequeat‚' had been sufficiently tested.
· Even in his finest passages the versification is monctonons, the diction
cumbrous and diffuse: his lines follow each other with 8 certain uni-
formity‚ each containing a given portion 81 118 88818888, instead 81
being iused together into a complex and inextricable harmony: tha
words are arranged iu a prosaic order, adjectivae and substantivas
coming together, though both may be terminated hythe same sound:
sometimes weare surprised by a new and startling metaphor, sometimes
wearied hy expressions which appear to be mere aurplusagc. Iu virgil,
on the contrary, the imagination may or may not be awakened, but the
18818 18 almost invariably satished. The superiority 81 118 versification
to that of any earlier author whose works have come down to ns is some·
thing extraordinary. His lines are as far removed from those 81 Lucre-
tius 0r Catullus as Pope’s are, Ι (18 881 say from Dryden's, but from
Spenser’s. N ever harsh or extravagaut, his langnage 18 81118 sametime
never mean or trivial. The position ef his words isa stndy in itself.
Even where he takes a line or phrase from a previous writer, he incor-
poratos it with a skill which, in the absence 81 evidence to the 1881, might
make us thinlr that he is not appropriating auothsr’s, but reclaimiug
his own. This difference is still more perceptible in the strictly didactic
parts, the stapla, iu fact, 81 118 two poema. Ilew of those who read the

De Rerum Natura read it contiuncusly: few, 11 any, 81 those who read
the Georgica read them in any other way. There is however another
