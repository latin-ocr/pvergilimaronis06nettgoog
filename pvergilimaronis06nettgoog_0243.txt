BUCOLIC POE'I'S OF ROME. 123

seven Eclognes, because, according to Servius, only seven of Virgil's
⁵ are rustic proper. Wernsdori had passed lightly over an apparent
objection to hia theory founded on the similarity oi passages in the
earlier Eclognes to passages in the later, alleging other iustanoes in
which poets repeat themselves: Haupt contenda that this apology does
not touch the case oi the third and ninth Elclogues, the latter of which
is an obvious though unskilfnl imitation of the former. Having thus,
as he conceives, shown that the poema in question cannot be by Cal·
purnius, he endeavours to prove that they are rightly attributed tc
Nemesianus, pointing out soma resemblanoes between them and Nemo·
manus' Cynegetica, and urgiug that the silence oi Vopiscus is not oi
that kind which would establieh a negative. He shows that the MS.
evidence ior divided authorship, instead oi resting ou a single copy, is
really supported by two others, cneci them the best of all, the Nea·
politan, and hythe traditiones a third; while he considers the inscrip-
tion oi Calpurnius' Eclognes to Nemesianus to have arisen from a cou-
fusion between the concluding ‘Explicit Calpurnii bucolicon ’ aud the
opening ‘Aurelii Nemesiani Carthaginiensis bucolicon incipit,’ which
would follow it immediately, and cites other instances oi similar amal·
gamations by transcribere. Iastly‚ hc separatas the two pects, who
had been previously supposed to be contemporaries, by a guli oi more
than two centurias, leaving Nemesianus at the date tc which he is
commonly fixed hy external evidence, the date ci tho emperor Carus
and his sons, and advancing Calpurnius, whose ordinary date rests
partly on the inscription tc Nemesianus mentioned above, partly on an
arbitrary identification oi him with a certain Junius Calpurnius, named
by Vopiscus as the emperor's ‘magister memoriae,’ to the time of N ero,
tc whose reign he points out several allusione in the Eclogues. With-
out presuming to affirm or deny the validity oi this chain² of reasoning,
Ι may perhaps be allowed ao far to adopt Haupt’s position as to speak
oi Nemesianus as the author oi four out oi the claren pastorale.
Calpurnina’ first Eclogue is a sort oi imitation oi the Pollio, intro-
duced by a dialogus between two shepherds, brothers, Ornitus and
Corydon, who, as they take refuge from the beat in a cave sacred to
hunus, observo some verses carved on a bacch-trec, apparently, so it
is intimated, by the prophetie god himself. In these verses Faunus, in
language reminding us sometimes oi Virgil's Daphnis, sometimes of
Jupiter’s speech to Venus in Aeneid 1, sometimes again ot the portcnts
at the end of Georgia 1, announces that the goldcn age has come, that
justicehas returned under the auspices of the youth who became apleader

¹ ΜΓ. Merirale (Hist, vol. vii, p. 41) thinks Haupt’s arguments about the date oi
Calpurnius inconclusive‚ aud contenda that the allusion to the emperor at the end oi
tha seveuth Eologue ‘⁸ points much better to Domitian.” On the other hand, Mt.
Crmvcll beltevoe the emperor in question tc be the youngest Gordian
