somewhat complicated by the relations of the third book of Nonius to
Charisius, which must now be brielly considered.

Charisius, pp. 70-109, has a section in which, among other instances
of anomaly and doubtful usage in grammar, the question of words
with a double gender is discussed. The main characteristics of this
section are, (1) that the words are not arranged in alphabetieal order,
but in small groups which arc sometimes alphabetieal, sometimes formed
according to the meaning of the words, but often, as far as we can
see, quite casua13 (2) that stress is constantly laid on the difference in
meaning of similar words, or different genders, or different forms, of
the same word ; (3) that Persius is the latest author quoted3 (4) that
the latest authority quoted is Pliny’s work dubii saissonis: while
Verrius Flaccus, Iulius Modestus, and Varro are not seldom cited.

On comparing this section of Charisius with the third book of
Nouius, we find that upwards ot forty words discussed are common
to both works: and that in a considerable number of instanees a
passage quoted in Charisius by way of illustrationis also cited to
illustrate the same word in Nonius. This is the case, for instance,
with olous, anquis, balteus, cinis, contagio, calc, caseus, frenas, foram,
pree, intubas, praesepio, panis, palumbes, penas, papaver, accessibiles,
scopula, stirps, tapete, culpas.

It must be added, however, that it seldom, if ever, happens that this
coincidence in the passages cited extends to more than one quotation
among several adduced.

The section oi Charisius differs, however, from the third book of
Nonius in three important particulare. In the first place, it does not
treet merely of the question of gender, but of other difficulties of form
as well, es of anomaliae in declension, the comparison of adjectives,
the formation of adverbs, and the derivationes nonns3 secondly, it
is not arranged alphabetieally3 and thirdly, it considers differenoes ot
gender very often aa indicatione of difference in meaning, while
N onius confines himself almost entirely to the question of form.

It is reasonable, then, to infer that this section of Charisius was
drawn from some work which dealt with anomaly in formation in a
sporadio and miscellaneous way, not by way of lists strictly drawn
up in alphabetieal order, or confined to particular branchos of the
subject.

Proceeding now to compare this part ol Charisius with the corre· ι
spondiug parts of Priscian, we find the same kind of relation existing
between Charisius and Priscian as between Charisius and Nonius,
namely‚ that Priscian seems in contrast to Charisius to be drawing
upon a strictly grammatieal work or works. Some of the words
(about fourteen, I think) are treated by all three writers, Nonius„
