INTRODUOTION. 143

of an increasing corruption in teste. He wrote a work on γλῶσσαι, aud
his own poems contain many words which would fall under thet
category3 terms borrowed from Homer, aud used in questionable or
altogether unautborized senses; terms horrowed from the local usage of
the different Greek natione, the Aeolians, the Aetoliam, the Ambra·
ι ciana the Cypriam,the Dorians, the Peloponnesians, and the Rhodiens3
terms invented by his own ingenuity, through the process of derivation
or composition. The structure of the two poems, so far as I have
examined them, seems to be not nnhke that which is familiar to the
readers of didactic poetry. anh commences with a brief address to
the person to whom the poem is inscribed, and a brief statement of
the subject, in the one case a description of noxious reptiles, aud of the
cures for their bites, in the other an account of edible and potablc
poisons and their remedies; each consiste of a number of paragrapho of
moderate length, apparently bearing a substantial resemblance to one
another, connected by modes of transition which are not quite free
from sameness, and occasionally reliered by some mythologicnl or
geographioal notice, and each ends with a brief reference to the author,
whom the person addressed is requested to bear in mind. In the
Theriaca there are one or two passages which enable us to compare
Nicander more closely with Virgil. The directions in the Third Book
of the Georgica to get rid of serpente from the cattle-sheds by fumi-
gation are to be found at the opening of Nicander's poem. Later in
the poem occur a few lines on the chersydros, which bave supplied
Virgil with the details oi his picture of the balefnl serpent which
hannts the mountain lawns of Calabria. Evory render of the Georgica
will recognize² the monster that at first under the wide-threated laha
wages truceless war with the frogs, but when Seirius dnos up the
water, and the dregs at the bottom of the lake are seen, appears that
moment on land, adnst and bloodless, warming his grim form in the
sun, and hissingly with out-dartod tongue makes a thirsty furrow as

hed‘hdsmention of these metaphrastes may perhaps indicate the right

Iam not sure that 1 have in all cases rightly interpreled the words, as in a writer like
Nioander thereis room for considerable differences of opinion: bnt I hare endeavoured
to render closely, so us to give some notion of his style.
