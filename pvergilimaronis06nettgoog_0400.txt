Tus cars 01211111110111 animale 21112 are bred bytho former forms the subject 01 the
Third Beck. These are divided inte twe mein classes, which 111 distinguished in
Latin as “ armenta '' and “ pecudes,'' the former including homed cattle and horses,
2111 112211 the smaller cattle, sheep and goats, while a word is thrown 111 (11. 401·-
113) about dege. The former occupies the larger portion oi the 11001111. 49-283:
2111 0012 however allows himself to digress in the last paragraph 01 the division, vv.
242 fell, speaking 01 the 121102 01 sexnal passionen the whole animal creatien.
Even in 2111 earlier portion the subject is not very regularly treated. Virgil eom·
111011 by saying (vv. 49 1011.) that a breeder 01 oxon or horsea ought 20 attend pnr-
tienlarly to the 0110101 01 the dams. A description 01 10011 follows; but nothing is
said 01 1 mare. At last (vv. 72 loll) he changes 2111 subject to horses, but it is that
he may talk, net 01 the dams, but 01 the sires Thus instead 01 deseribing the oow
. and the mare, the bull and the stellion, he consults variety by describing the female
0101101111, the male 01 the other. In what follows 111 211121 01 both classes indif-
ferently; but true 20 his preference 0100121011 ornament te 011021011 1001110011
dces not so much generalize as confuse, using language which is sometimes applica·
bie to eren, sometimes 20 herces. At last (11116 1011.) he is led 20 101111 more
particularly 01 the former with respect to their early training; 2111201111, he bestows
1 similar paragraph on 2111 latter. But this proportion is soon violated. Spenlring
oi the effect 01 the sexual passion, he lavishes all his powers 01 minute description
en the bull, in the well-known picture 01 the fight between two bulls 101 the same
heiler (vv. 2191011). Horses and mares are indeed mentioned, but net with the
same prominenee, 2111 former being introduced cursorily in 2111 digression on the
sexual iury 01 the whole animal creation, 2111 112211 forming the conclusion 01 that
digression. In the second part 01 1111 subiect Virgilis perhaps more systematie;
but he digresses more. The mention 01 pasturing the 1100111 11 summer and winter
leads 20 the two celebrated descriptious (vv. 339 1011.) 01 1 Libyan shepherd’s 11111-
mer and a Scythian shepherd’s winter, in 2111 1022110111111011 special pastoral details
are soon lest in a 0102111 01 the general features 01 the scene. And the narrative 01

“ the pestilence in Seuthem Italy, with which, in imitation 01 Lucretius, he has
eboscn to conclude the boch, is essentially digressiva, following, 11 12 does, the 101-
tunes 01 other animale besides those which are 2111 subjecto 01 the sarmer's care, and
in general being so conducted that ths 1111111 peruses 12 as an independent story,
and does 1021111 the 0121121112 01 1 regular 0110112101 olosing this part 01 tue
