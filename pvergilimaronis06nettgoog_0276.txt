156 GEORGIOA.

troduotion to Book 4 would support the hypothesis of more extensive
changes, though we need not suppose them in ony cose to heve mon snoh
es seriously to interrupt the composition oi the Aeneid. Whether the ·
poet’s resideuoe ot Noples (G. 4. 564), which ie mentioned osii it syn-

ehronized with Caeser's progress in the llost, is to be understood ns
referring to the entire time during which the Georgios were written,
or only to their eompletion is not oleer. Mn. Keightley remarks thet
the whole espeot oi the poemis Compenien: others heve maintained os
decidedly thet it is Mentosn. The lougnego in G. 2. 197 would snit
Mantua better, es Ι heve ,there observed, while Spohn urgues thot
southern Itely oon hardly heve boen sufficiently tranquil to induoe
Virgil to fix his residenoo there before 718. It would be eosy to
suggest thot the poem nes written pertly ot Mantus, partly, if not
prinoipelly‚ ot Neploe z but perheps we hove not dete enough even for
so unembitions e hypothesis.
