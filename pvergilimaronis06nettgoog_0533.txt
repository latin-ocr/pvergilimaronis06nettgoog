DIDAO'HO POETS OF ROME. 413

Luctandum est, quse nosse nimis, quid? dicere, quantum est?
Carmine, quid, proprio? pedibus, quid, iungere certis l'‘

The fourth hook commences with some reflectione on the problem of
human liic, which he solves by the doctrine of iate.

“Quid tam sollicitis vitam consumimus annis,
Torquemurqne metu caecaque cupidine rerum,
Aeternisque senes euris dum quaerimus aevum,
Perdimus, et nullo votorum flne besti
Victuros agimus semper, nco vivimus uuquam?
Pauperiorque bonis quisque cst, quo plura requirit,
Nec quod habet numerat, tantum quod uon habet optat:
Cumque sui parvos usus natura reposcat,
Materiam struimus maguae per vota ruinae,
Luxuriamquc lucris emimus, luxuque rapinas,

Et summum census pretium est, effundere censum.
Solvite, mortales, animos, curesque levate,

Totque supervacuis vitam deflere querellis.

Fata regunt orbem, certa stant omnia lege,
Longaque per certos signantur tempora casus.”

Not content with enunciating his discovery, he proceeds to apply it,
tedicusly enough, to the various events in mythical and historical
times. Withont iate, he aske, could the fire have fied from Aeneas?
could Troy have been victorious at the very crisis of its destiny?
would the wolf have reared the two brothers? would Rome have been
developed cut of a few cottages? could shepherds have made the
Capitol the seat oi the lightnings, and enclosed J opiter in his own
iortrcss? Mucius, Horatius, Cloelia, the iate of the Curiatii, the
battles of Cannae and Trasimene, the fall oi Carthago, the escape oi
Hannibal by death, the social and civil ware, Marius lying a rain
among ruine, and rising from the precinctu of Carthage io conquer a
world, Pompcy burut on the shore oi Nile, aud Caesar bloeding in the
· senate, all show that there must he Fato in the world.

“ Hoo nisi seta darent, nunquam fortuna tulisset”

A specimen of his narrative power occurs in the fifth book, where,
having to speak oi the constellation oi Andromeda, he bellethe talc
of her deliverance by Perseus in a style which, as Bernhardy aptly
remarks,² reminds us of the show-piceas oi Seneca the tragediam. These
are Perseus' feelings when he first sees tho beautiful prisoner.

“Isque ubl pendentem vidit dc rupe puellam,
Deriguit facie, quem non stupefecerat hostis,
Vixque manu spolium tenuit, victorque Medusae
Victus in Andromeda est. Iam cautibus invidet ipsis,
