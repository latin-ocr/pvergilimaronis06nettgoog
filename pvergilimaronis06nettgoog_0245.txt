BUCOLIC POETS ΟΕ ΒΟΜΕ. 125

trec which first made him jealous. Iolas promises tc repert it, and is
rewarded at the same moment by the sight ci bis heitar, which he
kindly sets down as an omen oi his friend’s success.

The fourth Eclogue, Guescsr, is again political. Meliboeus, the shep-
herd·pcet’s patron, finds Corydon meditating a more than rustic song
in praise ef Caesar, a design in which his younger brother Amyntas is ι
also anxious to jein. 'Phe patron reminds Corydon that be had often
warned his brother against the thriftless occupation cf singing, and is

told that it is his own kindness which has placed them both above ·

want, and has given them the means of thinking oi such pursuits. As
the lines may, perhaps, possess some biographical interest, though the
images are obviously borrowed from Virgil’s first Eclogue, it may be
worth while to quote them, by way of a specimen oi the poet’s manner:

‘⁴ Haec ego, confiteor, dixi, Meliboee: sed clim:
Non eadem nobis sunt tempora, nou Deus idem:
Spes magis adridet Certe ne fraga rubosque
Colligerem‚ viridique lamam solarer hibisco,
Tu facis, et tua nos alit indulgentia farre.

Tu, nostras miseratus opes docilemque iuventam,
Hiberna prohibes ieiunia solvere fago.

Ecce nihil querulum per te, Meliboee, sonamus,
Per te secura saturi recubamus iu umbra,

Et fruimur silvis Amaryllidos, ultima nuper
Litore terrarum, nisi tu, Meliboee, fuimes,
Ultima visuri, trucibusque obnoxia Mauris
Pascua Geryonis, liquidis nbi cursibus ingens
Dicitur occiduas impellere Baetis harenas.
Scilicet extremo nunc vilis in orbe iacerem,

Α dolori et pecudes iuter conductus Iberes
Inrita septem modularer sibila canna,

Nec quisquam nostras inter dumeta Camenas
Respiceret, nou ipse daret mibi forsitan aurem,
Ipse Deus, vacuam, longeque sonantia vota
Scilicet extremo non exaudiret in orbe.”

Meliboeus, after deprecating an expression in which Corydon appa-
rently speaks of himself us successor of the great Tityrus (donbtless
Virgil), consents to listen to an amoebean song from the brothers in
honour oi the emperor. They invoke Caesar, spenk of his superhuman
power in calming the wccds, rendering the cattle prolific, and fertilizing
the country, of the freedom to dig tresenre and celebrate rural festivities,
and the general security anjcyed under his reign, and finally hope that
this Deity may live and rule for everen earth. Meliboeus eompliments
them on the improvement in their singing which the change of subject
has produced, and Corydon in return hopes that he will prove a second
Maecenas to a second Virgil, introducing him to the imperial city, and
bidding him risa from rural to martial stralus.
