cxii THE ΤΕΧΤ OF VIRGIL.

between these two recensione is often difficult, and sometimes (1 think)
impossible.

In the case ol Latin manuscripts written prior to the Reuaissance,
there is not necessarily any magio in age, except iu so far as the oldest
copies may on the whole be trusted to preserve a better orthography.
In other respecta the manuscripts of Virgil are (as we have seen) not
by any means free from grcss blunders. But the concurrent testimony,
cn the oue handel several fifth century manuscripts, and, on the
other, oi the receusiou or recensione used by good grammariane and
commentatore, hae combined tc preserve the text of Virgil from serious
corruption. In most cases of doubt we have a choice between two or
more readings, either or any of which might fairly be adopted without
violetien of grammar, sense, or taste; and thus the margin leit for
conjectural emendationis comparatively narrow.

Whether much matter of value is to be obtained from the countless
manuscripts oi Virgil written from the time of the Carolingian revival
to the Renaissauce, is very doubtful. The Gudian (ninth century),
standing es it does iu close relation to the Palatina, is useful where
the latter feils us; end one oi the Berua manuscripts (Ribbeck’s α)
seems to stand in a similar relation to the Romanas. But, so far asI
have been able to observe, by tar the greater number of valuablc
readings given by the cursive manuscripts are either to be found in
the uncials and the notes of the ancient commentatore and gramma-
rians, or are euch ae might easily have been restored, if necessary, by
conjecture.
