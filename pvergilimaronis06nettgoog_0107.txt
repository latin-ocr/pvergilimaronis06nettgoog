THE ANGIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. ciii

with those of the anonymous commentary on the Georgica. The argu-
ment ie not conclusive, for it assumes on the one hand that Iunilius
Flagrusis a corruption of the name Iunius Philargyrius, aud on the
ether that the coincidence of the notes attributed to Flagrus iu the Berne
scholia with those which have hitherto been assigned to Philargyrins
provee unity of authorship, whereas it need prove no more thau nnity
ef origin Still the facts alleged tend to establish a probability, which
I think justifies us in still quoting the notes in question undar the

name of Philargyrins.

The commentary itself isa good one, based ou excellent sources, and
quite worthy to rank with that of Servius. The date of its compilation
ie quite uncertain3 but judging from its general style and tene, Ishonld
be dispcsed to think that it could not be placed later thau the fourth
century nr> There rs no mention ιιι it eitherof Donatus or of Serviue3
but it might he rash to infer anything from this fact. It rs also true
that Servius ,though he mentions Donatus says nothing of Philargyrius
Does this prove that Philargyriue was his contemporary, οι that he
lived later?

The commentarios of Servius and of Philargyrius ou the Georgica
are independent cf each other; bnt there is plenty of evidence to show
that for all that constitutea, so te speak, the hackhone oi their work,
for their grammar, lexicography, history, and antiquities, they are
alike dependent on the stores of information gathered hy the scholare
of the first and the beginning oi the second centnrics. Thia could he
easily shown hy a comparison of their notes in detail with notes in

Festus, N onius, Gellius, and the grammarians, such as that of which I
have attempted to give a specimen in the preceding sectione.

SERVIUS.

The name of this commentatoris given iu all MS S. earlier than the
fifteenth century simply as Servius3 and Priscian in quoting his werke -
knowe of no praenomen οι cognomen! 'Phe name Maurus Servius
Honoratus ie highly suspicions, occurring as it does only iu fifteenth
century manuscripts. A note of the pseudo-Acron on Horace, Sat. 1.

9. 76, mentions a “ Servius, magister Urbis‚'’ as offering an ex·
planation of the word attestari. Whether we have any right to identify

this person with our Servius ie extremely doubtful.
Serviusia introduced as one of the interlocutors in the Saturnalia

On G. 4. 89, tha note oi Flagra ie different from that of Philargyrius, and on

G. 4. ⁵65 they are independent.
Aa a rute, the notes iu the Beme scholia gives short abstruct of those in the

Philargyrian commentary, though thia is not always tha case.
