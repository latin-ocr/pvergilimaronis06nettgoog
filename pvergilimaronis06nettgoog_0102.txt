xcviii THE ANGIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

extent than now appears by Nonius, in whose writiugs, as we have
seen, a grata deal of lexicographical work is embedded.

Τ1111111111 Terentius Scaurus, the author of 1 Latin grammar 111
a controversial treatise against Caesellius Vindex, as well as of com-
mentarios on Plautus and Virgil, brings us into the reign of Hadrian.
Gellius calls him (11. 15. 3) “diri Hadriani temporibus grammaticus
vel nobilissimus.’' His grammatical works are cited by Gellius aud
the later grammarians: of his commentary on Virgil so little isexpressly
quoted that it would be rash to pronouuce any judgment upon its
merite. In A. 3. 484, “ 111 cedit honori,’‘ Servius tells us that Scaurus
read “honore” The Verona scholia quote a note 11111111 Crete 4.
146, 111 another on 5. 95, iu which a theory is advocated that snakes
are born from the marrow oi men: a notion which also appears in
Serrius‘ note on the passage.

The Carthaginien Sulpicius Apollinaris, the master of Aulus Gellius
as well as of the unfortunate emperor Pertinax, paid considerable
attention to Virgil. A note of his on ‘⁶ Silvius Albanum nomen, tua
postuma proles,” 111, 11 which he controverted the opinion oi Caesel-
lius Vindex, is mentioned by Gellius 2. 16. 8. Gellius, 7. 1612, says
that he took “praepetes aves” as equivalent to Homer‘s οἰωνοί
rawrre'poyes: 111 16. 5. 41111. quotes his opinion on the prefix oe in
remoue, 1111111, vestibulum. As far as 11111111 concerned, Sulpicius
seems merely to have quoted the opinion of Verrius Flaccus (111
abore p. lin), as indeed he aleo did in the case oi the word portamus
(comp. Festus, p. 238).

= POLLIO.

A scholar of this name with the reomau Asiuiusis mentioned by Ser·
vius on Aen. 2. 7111 elsewhere several times. The remarks attributed
to him are foolish and hardly worth quoting. On the passage just
alluded to, for instance, he seems to have observed that “duri miles
Ulixi” was meant ior Achaemenides. Itis possible, of course, that
the celebrated Asinius Pollio may hare criticised Virgil, but that such
notes can have come from him, or 11111 any scholar ol the Augustau
age, is almost incredible‚ and I am therefore inclined to agree wIth
Ribbeck (Prol. p. llo) thatii the Pollio of Servius is to be identified
with any known person, he was probably the scholar mentioned twice
by Marcus Aurelius (Fronto, pp. 42, 63, Nabar) as au excellent com·

IULIUS HATERIANUS.

Haterianus is mentioned as a commentator on Virgil by Macrobius
(3. 8. 2), 111 several times iu the Verona scholia. He is assumed by
