, life we mey safely conclude that, at the time of the composition
of the Eclogues at any rate, his associatione were those of a student,
not those of a tourist. Nor would it be just to stigmatize the pre·
dilection which this indicates as merely conventionul. It may he
narrow, bnt within its limits it is genuine. There are some minds
which are better calculated, et least in youth, to be impressed by the
inexhaustibleness of Art than by the infinity of Nature. They may
leck the geuial susceptibility which in others is awakencd immediately
by the sight of the world without, and they mey not have hed time to
educate their¹ imperfect sympathies into a fuller appreciation ; hut
they respond without difficulty to the intitutions oi natural beauty
ae conveyed to them through an intervening medinm, adopted hy its
own perfectiori for the transmission ci the perfectiori which existe

beyond. They see with the eyes oi others, not with their own ; bnt

. their seul nevertheless receives the vision. Over such minds the

recollecticn of a word in a book has the same power which others
find in a remembered sight or sound. It recalls not only ite own
image, but the images which were seen in company with it: ney, it
may touch yet longer troius of association, and come back upon the
memory with something like the force of the entire body oi impres·
sione originally excited by the work which happens to contain it.
Even those who have held more direct intercourse with nature are not
insensible to the operation oi this secoudary cherm. Cen any one who
reads Milton doubt that the mere sound ol the stately names oi classic
history and mythology exercised a real influence on the poet’s fancy?
And Mr.Tennyson has given us a testimony⁸ to the constraining magio
of Virgil's own languege, where he speaks of himself as haunted
during his journey from Come not by the thought of the overllowing
lake, but hy the ‘bellad-bnrtheu music‘ of Lori Maxume.

It is not, however, the existence of imitation alone, considered merely
ae imitation, that makes us epeak of the Eclogues as unreal. Imitation
involves the absence of reality, just as translation does, simply because
the thing produced is not original: but it need not imply its destruc·
tion. But with the Eclogues the case is different It is not merely
thet Virgil formed his conceptiones pastoral poetry from Greek models,
hut that he sought to apply it to Roman life. In the vocabulary ol
poetry, as he understood it, e shepherd wasa Sicilian, or perhaps an
Arcadiam therefore an Italian shepherd must he spoken oi as an
Italian Sicilian, and pastoral Italy as Sicilian Italy. Instances of this
historical and geographical confusion meet us in every page of the
Eclogues. The very fact that the names of the shepherds arcinvariebly ι
»Greek would naturally he sufficient to warn us what we are to expect
