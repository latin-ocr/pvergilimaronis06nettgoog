THE ANGIENT GOMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

Ir was not long before the poems of Virgil began to afford matter

’ for discussion to lexicographers, grammariaus, aud writers ou an-

tiqnity. The first scholar whoactually lectured upon Virgil was
Quintus Caecilius Epirota, for informatiou about whom we are entirely
dependent upon Suetonius (De Grammaticis, 16). He was, it appears,
a freedman of Pomponius Atticus, the friend of (licere, and was born
. at Tusculum. His aequoreae suggests that be may have been the
child ol Epirot parente, brought over, perhaps, from the estates of
Atticus in Epirus. 'Phe daughter of Atticus was married to Marcus
Vipsanius Agrippa, aud Caecilius was tutor to this lady. On account
of a suspicion which arose against him with regard to bis conduct iu this
relation he left the family of Agrippa, and lived henceforth on terms
ol intimate friendship with the poet Cornelius Gallus. His character
was so anlavourably regarded by Augustus that this intimacy was
the occasion of one ol the gravest charges brought against Gallus by
the emperor. After the condemnation aud death of Gallus, Caecilius
opened a school fora few young men, to whom he lectured on Virgil
and other contemporary poete. Whether this was before Virgil’s
death or not there is uo evidence to decide. A verse written upon him
by Domitius Marsus-

“Epirota teuellorum nutricula ratum?

seems to be pointed at the real or supposed effeminacy of bis character.

Verrius Flaccus, the compiler of the first Latin lexicon ever written,
must have puid a great deal of attention to Virgil His work De
Verborum Sipaijicuta has, as is well known, survived only in the
abridgmeuts ol Festus aud Paulus. Eveu in these, a considerable
number ol quotations from Virgil is to be fouud3 aud I am inclined
to think that several of the original glosses of Verrius may be
pertially reconstructed from later writers, notably from Nonius and
Macrobius, who seem to have preserved them in a fuller form than
Paulus or even Festus. Thus Paulus has preserved the following gloss
on daedalw (p. 68, Miiller), Dcedolcma varietate rerum artificiorumque
dictum esse apud Lacretirwn terram, apud Ennium Minervam, apud
