THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. cv

commentary thus enlarged hasbeen generally known as the Servius of

Daniel.⁶ Scholars soem now agreed that these additional notes were
not part oi the original commentary of Servius, bnt were copied into
bis work from a work of equal antiqnity and protensione I offer no
opinionon this question, which seerm to me still open to discussion,
as even the Vulgata of Servius is not so completely homogeneons as to
exclude the hypothesis of its author having left his work in a com·
paratively undigested form.l

However the case may stand with these additions, there is no doubt
that the Vulgata of the commentary bearing the name of Servius is on
the whole a homogeneous work, not a mere congeries of notes acci·

dentally bearing the name of a celebrated scholar. Itis true that its
author has sometimes allowed inconsistencies to remain, as, for instance,
when iu one passage, at the beginning of his notes on the Aeneid, he
quotes arma ciramqae caao as the first words of the Aeneid, and two
lines below says that Virgil began differently. The same entolina, too,
is often repeated on different passages in almost thesemo words.
Agein, the author sometimes refers to a note which he either never
wrote, or which has disappeared from our manuscripts. 'Pbis case,
however‚is quite exceptional. The commentary constantly refers back
to notes which really exist, an almost decisive mark of its coming from
one hand.

It is plain, Ithink, that the commentary of Servius isthc work of
an adherent of theold religion. Itis not merely that its author gives
no sign of any leaning ιο Christianity‚ or knowledge of it, bnt that he
shows a decided fondness for the forms and antiquities of the old
Roman worship. Taking the commentary as a whole, I am inclined ιο
characterize it as one of the works which, like the Saturnalia of
Macrobius, marks the reaction in favour of the past, which took place

among the Roman literati at the end of tbe fourth and the beginning
of the fifth centuries ao.

'Phe commentary of Servius may, so far as its tonsis concerned‚
