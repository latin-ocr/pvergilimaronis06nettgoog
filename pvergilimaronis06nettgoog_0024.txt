xx LIFE OF VIRGIL.

meaning thereby, Ι suppose, the worthless hexameter poem which hes
come down to us under that name, end which concludes as Suetonius
says Virgil‘s poem concluded. Suetonius is not alone responsible 111
this statement, 111 1 literery tradition as old as Lucan⁸ assigned this
piece to Virgil’s youth 11 boyhood. The poem is poor enough in itself,
and (as Mr. Mauro hes pointed 111 to me) stands sufficieutly cou-

demued 11 metrieal grounds. For the author 11 the 01111 iscareful
in the matter of 11111111111111,11 possible, allewing two long vowels
to 11111111. This strictness is inconceivable in Virgil’s youth. A poet
who even 11 his ripest work allowed himself the greatest >freedom in
eliding vowels is not likely 11 have been pretematurally scrupulous in
his seventeeuth year.

Nc oue now thinks 11 attributiug the Giris or 1111111111 11 Virgil.
The workmauship 11 the chu and the Merulam is not unworthy 11

the Augustas ege; bnt this does not, 11 111111, prove that they are
from the hand 11 Virgil.

01 the short poeuis known under the various names 11 0111111111,
0111111111111 Cutolecta, bnt more rightly, 11 Bergk and Unger have
shown, named Catulepteu (τὰ κατὰ λεπτόν, 11 minor poenis), the second,
Corinthiorum amator iste cerberum, is expressly attributed 11 Virgil by
Quintilian (Β. 3. 27), though even this testimony cannot be accepted
as conclusive. 01 the fifth, Ite 1111 111111111111111111 ampullae,1
have already spoken; there seems no 111111 to doubt the genuineness
11 the tenth, Sabinus ille quem 11111111 1111111111 paredy 11 Catullus’
phasellus The eighth, Villale quae Sironis erus, purports 11 be written
by Virgil in the year 41, when he was iiying from his home. He
addreeses the villu 11 his master Siron, aud implores it to give shelter

about the passage. In Suetonius the Canonicien MS, which, though late, represents
ageod tradition, reads 11111111 111 1111111111 aud Servius' words 1111111 sive octo
require explanation. My own opinion is that Suetonius wrote 111111 diluens nim
esset ancienne xvi, aud that the rest is an interpolation. Servius‘ septem sire 1111
1 should explain by supposing that epiprammaea end cotulepton refer to the same
11111 minor poema: thet one word was written over the other as an explanation,
and thus crept into the text, und that the scribe, in doubt whether to count eps·-
prammcte end cataleptes as two sets 11 poema or one, saved his conscience by adding
1111 ecto aster septem. Baehrens, however, in his recent edition oi these poema
(Leipzig, 1880)‚accepts the text 11 Suetonius end Servius. whom he treats as in-

dependent authorities, es genuine, and contende that the title eeialepton includes ·

111 the minor poems attributed to Virgil, sud that the true title oi the short pisces
is epiprcmmots or praelusione. 1 agree' with him that epipremmaru would be a
very good term to designate the short pisces, but 1 doubt whether τὰ κατὰ λεπτόν
could include the larges· ones, and suspect that epiprammata aud easdem were
synonymous. ·
