LlFE OF VIRGIL. xxiii ’

ninth) to Varus, and oue (the tenth) to Gallus, who is also mentioned
in terme of the greatest affection in the sixth.

The acquaintance ot Horace with Virgil must heve began before
the publication oi the Hclognes. It was either in the year 40 or
38 or 37 (the year when the last Hologue was probably composed),
that Virgil, with Varius and Tucca, the future editors oi his Aeneid,
joined Horace at Sinuessa on ajourney to Brundisium.⁷ Horace speaks
of Virgil as at that time one of his most intimate friends, asii their
acquaintance were now oi long standing. The only relic, as farasI
em aware, of the early period oi this friendship is the twelith ode of
Horace's fourth book, which, in spite of the fact that this hook was
published after Virgil's death, it seems reasonable to refer to him.
The ode, which Horace perhaps had not cared to publish before, is
addresscd to a Vergilius whom Horace aske to dinner on condition of
his bringing with him abox oi nard in exchange for Horace’s wine.
The language ot the poem would very well suit the time when both
poets were young and Horace poor, and before his introduction by
Virgil, the iuvenem nobilium cliens, to the circle of Maecenas.

Horace's judgment of the Holognes⁸ is well known: “molle atque
facetum (epos) Vergilio adnuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae‚'’ the
Muses have granted him tenderness and refiued wit in his hexameter
writing. The literary sympathy and intimate friendship between
Horace and Virgil was of immense importance as affecting the history
of Roman literature. It was they who, while enjoining a closer study
of the Greek masterpieoes in their length and breadth than had
hitherto been given to them, formed the classicel style of Roman poetry,
and shewed how close imitation ot great models was compatible
with a free and noble manner, untainted by pedantry or servility. I
have endeavoured elsewhere⁰ to collect some ot the passages which
resemble each other in the earlier works of these twin poete, thus
attesting (in all probability) a constent and intimate communication
between them.

The Eclogues, says Suetonius,² were so popular that they were often

ι recited in the theatra. The same was the ease with some of the poems
oi Ovid. On one occasion, if we may believe 'l’acitua¹ the whole
audience rose on hearing some ol Virgil's verses, and testified their
homage to the poet, who happened to be present.

’ When Virgil began the Georgica there is no positive evidence to
determine. They were undertakeu partly in honour oi Maecenas,⁸ as

² Sat. 1. 5. 40.

¹ Sat. 1. 10. The date ol this satire cannot be later than 32 ac, and tho Georgica
were not finisbed till 29.
