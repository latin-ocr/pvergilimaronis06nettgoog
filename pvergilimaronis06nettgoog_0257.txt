me your oxen end your plough: and it is as easy to reply, My oxen
have their own work to do.’' Slave and master alike should put ho
their hand, tho master guiding hbe plough, nol wilhonh prayers to Zeus
and Demeter, while the slave a little behind gives trouble to the birds
by eovering the seed well up. The winter is the time for sooial meet-
ings: bul suoh things are not for idle waiteis on fortune. While itis
yet summer, a man should warn his slaves, “ Summer does nob lasl for
overe mehe barns for the oorn.'' Bul all should avoid the wintry eleet,
that pieroes even ube fur of shaggy beasls, the hide of the ox, and hhe
hair ol the gual, bul cannot reaeh eho sheep through iu thelmelaa
penetrale lhe hender skin of lohe maiden that sios a’o home wilh her
mother, or lies wann in bed, well balhed and anoinhed. Thea is the
time to go warm clad and thick ahod, finish work early, and get home
before the storin. At lho rising of Arcturus the vines are to be pruned
belone the swallow appears 3 bul when House-earrier⁸ (the snail) leaves
eho ear-lh and mounts the trees, then ’ohe siokle should be sharpened
and rho slaves called early. “Morning culs off a third ol the day’s
work: morning makes way in travelling, and makes way in working-
morning, whose down sets many a man on his read, and puts the yoke
on many an ox.” Bul when the thislleis in blossom, and the cicala pours
its midsommer song from lhe trees, weary man must look lor enjoy-

kid's flesh to eat. As soon as Orion rises, the corn should be winnowed:
thau done, the slave should be turned out, and a spinster without a
child felched in, and the walch-dog fastened up for fear ol thiaves.
When Orion and Sirius are in mid-heaven, let lhe grapes be gathered:
when the Pleiades and Hyades and Orion set, ie is timeto think of

should think of sellinges well he may, sseing that his. father and
Hesiod's sailed from Cyme to Ascra, a bad dwelling-plaee either in
winter or summer, all thal he might fly from poverty. For himself,
Hesiod owns thar he has had no great experienoe in ships: he has had
a single voyage from Aulis lo Euboea, when he went to Chalcis and won
a tripod wilh ears thera as a singingpriae: still, lho Muses heve i'n·
spired him, and he will give directione about this olso. The besl sesson
for sailing is al the end of summer, bul the mariner must hasten back
and avoid the autumn reins: the other lime is in spring, when the
leaves al the end of the sprayhave grown to the length of a erow’s fooh:
ho will nol, however, recommend it, as there is danger, though men per·
sisi in braviug it, and it is lorriblo lo dio al sea. From sailing he pasees
