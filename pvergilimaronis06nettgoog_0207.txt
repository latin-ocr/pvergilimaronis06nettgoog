PHARMACEUTRIA,
onnon snrnnsmonus

We bave here again the songs of two shepherds, Damon, in the character of a despair·
ing lover lamenting over his faithless Nysa, who has taken a less worthy mate, end
finally resolying on sslf-destruction, aud Alphesiboeus, in the character of a women
also forselren by her lover, though only for a time, and trying ιο reoower him by en·
‘chantmcnts which at last prore successful. ,

[Serv. says that this poem is addressed ιο Augustus, though hs mentions commen-
tators who took it as referring ιο Ροιιιο. The reference ιο Augustus can only be
defended by an unnntural if not impossible interpretation of v. 10. lt is mach more
probable that the pisce is addressed ιο] Ροιιιο, in a prefacs running parallel with
that to E. 6 (see Introduction there, and note on w. 'l here). Its date may be ilxed
from ww. 6 foll, which apparently point to the time when Pollio hed gained his
victory over the Parthini in Illyricum (‘ victricis laurus,’ w. 13, refuting the hypo·
thesis that it was addressed tobim when setting out on the expedition). and was on
his way horne to receive the triumph which hs celebrated Oct. 25, so. 715. Whether
' ‘⁴ iussis carmina coepta tuis,” w. ll, actually means that Polliosaggsstedcus ar both
of the subjecte of the Eclogue, or merely that he selred ιο bave another pastoral
written, is of course impossible ιο say. Voss chooses ιο fancy that it was for the
second song, se an imitation of the Pharmaceutria of Theocritus, that Pollio had
selred, and that Virgil intends ιο give it the preference, both by the appeal ιο the

Muses, wasme, and by the title of the whole poem. But Virgil's own words need ·

conwey no such notion (see note there), and there seems no reason to suppose that
the title Pharmaceutria was affixsd by the poet, especially as the Med MS. hes a
different title, “Damonis et Alphesiboei Certatio.”
