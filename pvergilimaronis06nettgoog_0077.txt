THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxxiii

presumably, iu the labri dubii semeonis), as well asin Caper aud
Probus.

After a digression ou active werde used passively (p. '393-396), the
alphabetical list interrupted on p. 392 is resumed at the werd munere,
and we have a list from m to u (minuero-uter), te which are finally
added a few mere worda (mamare, praesepio, and opino).

Comparing the lists given ou pp. eea-3 and 396 with the former
lists (pp. 379-387), it is impossible net te comete the conclusion that
they are derived (the first at second-hand) from two independant werke
treeting ef the same subject. Were the two lists supplementary to
each ether, did esch confine itseli to words which the ether omitted,
it would ef course be natural to argue that both came from the same
treatise. But this is not the case. The second list contains a cou-
siderable number ef words already included iu the first3 a sure sign
that Priscian is using twe distinct werke, each of which had its own
list, though the catalogues to seme extent covered the seme ground.

Priscian mentiens three writers as his authorities, Pliny, Probus,
aud Caper: “eorum et superiorum omnium usus tam apud Capram
quam Plinium et Probum invenies ''-“querum auctores apud Capram
legant qui eos scire desiderant.'‘ In some way or ether, then, we must
suppose that the honour ef these lists must be dividcd between these
three writers, er rather, between Pliny and Probus.

Let us new compare the lists of Priscian with that iu the seventh
hook of Nonius.

A large number of werde are commen te the lists ef Nonius aud
Priscian: between sixty and seventy, ii I am not wrong, eut ef a
hundred or rather mere. The majority ef the instances in Neuius
coincides with the second list iu Priscian : the others correspeud mestly
with the first, but in seme cases with netes in other parts ef Priscian.

This general coincidence would naturally lead us to infera common
origin for the lists ef Nonius aud Priscian ; and there are minor indica·
tiens which point iu the same directien. A few of Nenins’ instances
are to he found in Quintilian: this is the case with the notes en
adsentio, p. 469, punior aud subricor, p. 471, and luxurior, p. 481, forms
which are commented on hy Quintilian, 9. 3. 6. Of seme other notes

iu this part of N onius, we know that they are due to Caper, that is, iu ἵ

all probability, to Probus: this is the ease with the note en praenitebant,
p. 475 (see Prisc. l, p. 561), repulsatur, p. 476 (Prisc. l, p. 393),
adiciatur, p. 477 (Prisc. l, p. 391). The note eu capiere, p· 469, may
have been dua te Pliny, ior Servius, en A. 7. 273, quotes a note from
Pliny distinguishing between auguro and augurer.

Safar as these iudicatione ge, they seem to warraut the eenolnsien
te which the general resemblance between Nonius aud Priscian has
