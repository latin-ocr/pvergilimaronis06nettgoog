xxiv LIFE OF VIRGIL.

a taken of gratitudo for the assistance which he had given the poet in
116 troubles of the year 41. Theline in the first Georgia (509), 116
oravet Euphrates, illic Germania tellam, is usually taken as referring 16
116 events of 3⁷ a.c.; but Ι have tried to show in a nota on the pas·
saga that it was probably written in 33 or 32. We kuow⁴ that the
Georgica were read to Octavianus after his return from the East in
29 ac. This then is their terminas ad quem: 116 only terminataque

is the passage alluding to the portas Iulias in tha second Georgia (161).
Τ116 harbour was completed by Agrippa in 37 aa, and the verses in
question cannot therefore be earlier than that avent. And these limita
tally sufficiently with the statement of 866166166ὅ 1161 116 Georgius
were written in seven years.

Yet, if wa are 16 press literally the concluding lines of the fourth
Georgia Virgil must have written tha bulk of 116 three first Georgica
at Naples in the years 31-29, when Octavianus was scttling the affairs
of the 111661.θ Τ16 expressions 61 Virgil in this place need not, however,
mean more than 1161 16 was generally occupied with the work at that
time. He appears to have worked 61 116 Georgica very slowly‚ writing
only a very few lines every day ;7 and it may well 16 1161 although 16
had begua the poem as early as ac. 36, the final touches were added
between 31 and 29. The Georgica themselves dc not offer much in the
way of internal evidence towards enabling 66 16 decide when different
parts were composad. The openings of the first and third Georgia I
incline to think, were written for the recitation of 29 aa, later, that 16,
1166 anything else in the whole work: 116 conclusione of the first and
of the second Georgia are, perhaps, best referred to the end of 33 or the
beginning of 32 ac.

The opening of the third Georgic would be more easily intelligible
could we suppose that the book was written either in Graece, or after a
visit to that country. Tharais something to 16 urged in favour of
this hypothesis. In the third ode of his first book, Horace speaks of
a Vergilius, whom he calls animae dimidium arcae, aud for whom he
prays a safe journeyto the coast 61 Attica. It 16 difficult, if not impos·
sible, 16 suppose that this Vergilius can be any one but our Virgil.
