lvi VIRGIL AND HIS ANOIENT ORITlCS.

thus morea, crepito, lwrreo, tremulas, are all illustrated from Ennium
eo lychnus and aethra5 daedalus sud reboo, petulcus and ts'qut'das, from
Lucretius: arcitenens and dtoteola from Naevius.

These facts alone might fairly lead us to suspect that Macrobius ie

drawing upon glossas or philological works oi respectable antiqnity.
But the suspicion becomes something stronger when we find that some
of the notes are. traceable to Verrius Flaccus (daedalus, camaras,
petrdeus, auritas, and perhaps reboo), that others are common to Macro·
bius aud Nonius, and others again to those two writers, with Servius
aud other later commentatore. For I have endeavoured to show further
ou (p. lxviii. toll.) that the Virgilian notes which are common to Nonius
aud the later commentatore cannot be assigned to alater date thau the
ageos Trajan. And the conclusion to which we are led in the cass oi
the scholia, whose origin we can directly or indirectly traee, itis J
natural to extend to those of whose sources we are ignorant.

Ιι was not until atter these sheets had been sent ιο presa that 1 was able to
procuro two pamphlets, by Dru. Linke and Wissowa, ‘⁴ De Macrobii Saturnalicmm
fontibus,” Breslau, 1880. Dr. Linke, who goes much more tull y thau Dr. Wissowa
into the question ct the sources ot the Virgilian criticisms in Macrobius, has come
to the conclusion (l) that the additional notes in Daniel’s Servius are ancient
interpolatione: (2) that the &rrius oi our commentsry stands in no relation oi

Seruius borrowed, in a meet many instaures, directiy from Macrobius: (4) that
there are some cases, nevertheleee‚ where this cannot trave been the ause: (5) that
Macrobius 3. 1-12 is taken from two different munuels, ot uncertain date, each ot
which probably mutsined informatiou horrowed ultimately from Verrius Flaccus.

With regurd to (1) und (3) Ι would observa that the additional notes in Daniel's
&rrius may be interpolatione, but that whether they are so or not, they are, iu my
opinion, taken not troni Macrobius, but from a contiuuons commentary. For (l)
they osten extend without a break orer continuone lines; (2) they sometimes give
information which is not found in Macrobius: (3) they sometimes, in a very striking
way, ignore what is to be found iu him, as notably in the case of his sixth book
