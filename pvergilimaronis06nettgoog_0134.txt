14 BUOOLIOA„

found au artist who would submit to it without complaining. The
finished excellence oi his workmanship is a fact which will uot be readily
impeached or overlooked, though its importance may easily he under·
rated. We are apt, perhaps, not sufficiently to consider what is iu·
volved in the style or diction oi poetry. We distinguish sharply between
the general conception and the lauguage, as ir the power which strikes
cut the one were something quite different {rom the skill which elabo-
rates the other. No doubt there is a difference between the two opera·
tione, and one which must place a poet like Virgil at a disadvantage as
compared with the writers whom he followed 3 but it would be a mistake
to suppose that imaginatiou may not be shown in the words which
embody a thought as well as iu the thought which they embody. Το
express a thought iu language is iu truth to express alarger conception
by the help oi a number of smaller ones 3 and the same poetical faculty
which originales the one may well be employed in producing the other.
Itis not merely that the adaptatiou of the words to the thought itseli
requires a poet't sense, though this is much 3 but that the words them·
salves are images, each possessing, or capable oi possessing, a beauty oi
its own, which need not be impaired, but may be illustrated and set off,
by its relative position, as contributing ιο the development of another
and more complex beauty. Itis not necessary that these words, in
order to be poetical, should he pictoresque in the strict sense oi the
term; on the contrary, it may suit the poet’s object to make a physical
image retire into the shedc, not advance into prominent light: bnt the
imagination will still be appealcd to, whatever may be the avenne of
approach—by the effect ot perspectiva, by arttul juxtaposition, by
musical sound, or perhaps, as we have already seen, by remote intel·
lectus] association. The ceutral thought may be borrowcd or unreal,
yet the subordinate conceptione may be true and beautiful, whether the
subordination be that oi a paragraph to an entire poem, a sentence to a
paragraph, or a phrase or word to a sentence It is, Ι conceive, ιο ο per-
ception of this fact, and not to a defereuce to any popular or mechanical
notion oi composition, that the praise of style and execution in poetry
is to be referred. Poetry is defined by Coleridge⁷ to be the best words
in their right places, and though at the first statement his view may
appear disappoiuting and inadequate‚ it will perhaps he found that
further consideration will go iar towards justiiying its truth.

If the Augustas age is, as it is allowed to be by common consent,
the epoch ol thc perfectiori of art es applied ιο Latin poetry, that
perfectior is centred in Virgil and Horace. Ovid, the third great
representative poet of his time, sufficiently indicates that even then a
