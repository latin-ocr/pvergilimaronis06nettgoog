> poet from masking tha toilsome nature oi the task to which he cells

the farmer, thet he everywhere takes occasion to bring it out into
strong light, dwelling on it es in itself a source oi enthusiasm, and
urging those whom he addresses to spere no peius to melre the work
thorougb. Observa the form into which he throws his very first
sentence, as soon as the ceremcny oi invocation is over, and the
practicel part oi tha Georgica begun. “In the down oi spring,
when icy strecms trickle melting from the hoar mountnins, and the
crumbling clod breaks its chein et the west wind’s touch, evan then Ι
', would isin see the plough driven deep till the bull groens again, eud
tho share rubbed in the furrow till it shines.” All that is ornamental,
or, as it may be called, poetical in the latter part oi the sentence, tha
i deep-driving of the plough, the grenning oi the bnll, the shining of
the share, tende directly to one point, hard and unspcring labour. The
seme spirit may be discovered in the next sentence, concealed in the
:¹ single word ‘sensit' which denotes the leying bare, as it were, of the
r nerva of the soil to the two opposite influences by a thorough plough·
ing twice in each season. A few lines further on we have a passage
· which not only eniorces strongly the practica] duty of work, bnt states
the‘ theologice] ground (so to name it) on which it rests. “Remember”
--such in effect is Virgil’s language-“ that the special cptitudes oi
the soil must be studied. Different regions have different products:
corn is more congenisl to one, the vine to another. Such,” he goes ou
to say, “is the chain of lew, such the eternal covenant, with which
nature hes bound certain elimes, from the day when Deucalion first
hurled his stenes on the unpeoplcd globe‚ stenes whence sprung man’s
rece, hard as they.” In tha fourth Eclogue he hed said thet when
the golden ege oi the future should et length be fully consummated
the occupations of the seilor end the iarmer would ccase together: all
lcnds would produce all things: tha ground should not feel the harrow,
nor the vineyard the pruning-hook: the stnrdy ploughman too (mark
the epithat) should at length set his bullocks free from the yoke. But
snohis nottho dispensation under which men now live. The appro-

. priation of certain produceto certain soils isexpressly intended to make

lebour necessary ε end the seme order of things which ordsined labour
ordained frames ot stone and thews oi iron to grapple with it. What
is the moral? What, but that men und beest should accept the lew of
their being, and work with all their might? “Ergo age,'' concludes

the poet, “Ergo age, terrae
Pingue solum primis extemplo a mensibus suni
Fortes invertant tauri, glaebasque iacentis
Pulverulenta coquat maturis solibus cestss.'’
