ingless reading Poeniceum, which has taken possession oi the existing
copies, 10 remain in the textof Virgil. The same remark applies 10 110
defence of flores oriam against flavos crinea in Aen. 12. 605. Fictor
he defended by 00 appeal to ancient authors; and it is worth noticing
that Nonius, p. 109, hasa note 00 florae illustrated from Naevius. Is
Nonius drawing upon the notes of Probus, as Ribbeck is inclined 10
think he isin his seveuth book, or are both dependent cu some earlier
lexicographical authority?

In Aen. 10. 539, Probus was doubtless rightiu readingiaaipnibaa olbis,
not irreipoibus armis with Asper. More questionable is his judgment
iu the case of Aen. 1. 44, where hs would have us read transfixo tenc
pore, not transfixo pectore. In Aen. l. 441 he rightly defended by an
example from Sallust laetissimas umbrae against laetissimae ambro
(compare Servius (Dan.) on Aen. 11. 338). In 8. 406 he (and after
him Carminius) wished to read infusam for inficias. 10981410

interpretation. Servius ou the first line of 110 first Aeneid informs us
1101 Probus (following Cicero and Caesar) laid it (1000110111010,
(1001004100, should be written 011101.- a scholar's canon which is not
supported by 110 evidence of good inscriptions. From this fact Ribbeck
thinks it possible that Gellius, when in 4. 17 10 defends the orthography
inlice, 00111011, obiicitur, may be following in the trnck of Probus
(Prol. p. 139). On Aen. 1. 194, he made a distinction between the
active and passive forms of portio and other verbs of the same kind.

It should be observed that Nonius in treating of these words (pp. 472, ·

474) makes no distinction between the two forms: a fact which sug·
gests that he and Probus followed independent sources, or that Probus
made 110 distinction on his own judgmeut. The same is the case with
regard 10 Nonius in the note quoted from Probus on Aen. 4. 359, swano
1000300000. Nonius, p. 319, quotes Virgil’s words “ vocemque his
auribus hausi '’ as a good instance of metaphorical expression, just as
does Quintilian 8. 3. 54

In Aen. 3. 3 Probus took semet not as the present but as the con·

word pristinae (“ de hoc sermone quaerit Probus et alii‚” says Servius).
It would be interesting to know what relation this discussion bore to
