GEORGIOON LIB. III. 281

The exordium cf tha book has a biographical interest, as containing the most
definite sketch of the project, which Virgil doubtless stood pledged to executa, of a
poem in honour oi the exploits oi Oenoanda-a plan, not ol the Aeneid, but oi that
ior which the Aeneid was accepted as a compensation. It is in the course oi it that,
as vas mentioned in p. 147, the only passage occurs which seems as ii it must have
been written at a later daie than that assigned to the completicn oi the poem as a
whole. See on vv. 31, 32, 33.
