Sed circum tutae sub moenibus urbis aquantur,
Excmsusque brevis temptant, et saepe lapillos,

Ut cumbae instabiles fluctu iactante saburram, 111
Tollunt, his sese per inania nubila librant

Illum adeo placuisse apibus mirabere morem,

Quod neque concubitu indulgent, nee corpora segnes

In Venerem solvunt, aut fetus nixibus edunt3
