PREFACE ΤΟ THE FOURTH EDITION.

.-—————

Au the request of the publishers of Conington's Virgil I have
undertaken te revise the first volume of that work. The ortho-

his Virgil fall, in this respect, behind many even ef our recent

Virgil’s time, with the text, or with interpretation given by the
ancient commentatore. It will be observed that a much greater
number of MS. variants is mentioned than in the previous editions.
Althougb many of these are mere mistahes, they will, I hope, be
found of some use in assisting students to form a clearer idea than

sections inte which the books are divided in the editions of Jan
and Detleisen. Nonius is quoted according to the paging of
