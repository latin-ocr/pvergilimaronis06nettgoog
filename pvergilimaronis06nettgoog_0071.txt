THE AN OIlllNT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxvii

0 rational construction. On Aen. 12. 174, he explained altorio as
meaning “eaquae iu altaria funduntur '’ (comp. the Schol. Veron. on
Aen. 5. 93). 10 Fl. 6. 76 he defended the word 0000000 against the
objections of Cornutus (Serv. ad. 1., 00100. Gell. 2. 6 = Macrob. 6. 7. 4):
and it is 001 01 011 improbable, 00 Ribbeck suggests, that the whole 01
1110 sixth chapter 01 Gellins' second book is taken from the commen·
tary 01 Probus. On A. 9. 373 he defended “sublustri noetis iu umbra '²
by the example 01 Horace's “ nocte sublustri '⁹ (Schol. Veronensis), a
parallel which Servius borrows without aclmowledgment.

Not that Probus was blindly partia] 10 1110 author. “ Probo displicet
001000 rudor,'’ say Servius and the Verona scholia ou A 2.173; he
would have preferred the omission of A. 4. 418, “puppibus et laeti
nautae imposuere coronas ”3 01 the story about Camilla in A. 11. 554
he said 11101 11 was ἀπίθανον πλάσμα, an incredible fiction. Gellius, 9. 9.
12, 1011000 that he was very severe upon Virgil’s description 01 Dido
as compared with that by Homer 01 Nausicaa, which Virgil 10 copying.
Of A. 9. 369 (“ equites ex urbe Latini Ibant, 01 regi Turno responsa
ferebant”) the Verona scholia tell 00 11101 Probus and Sulpicius Apol·
linuris (that is, probably, Probus as quoted by Sulpicius Apollinaris)
complaiued thet it was inconsistent with 7. 600, “saepsit 00 tectis
rerumque reliquit habenas.”

Sachare some 01 the scanty relies of one 01 1110 most important
commentaries, perhaps the most important commentary on Virgil that
antiquity produced. 01 1110 existing commentary which bears, the
name 01 Probus it would be raah to say that it contains nothing which
can be traced to the hand 01 1110 master, but 11101 1110 bulk 01 11

¹ · historical blunder with which the commentary ou the Eclogues opens

—assigningas 11 does the confiscation 01 Virgil’s estate 10 1110 time
which followed the battle 01 Actium-it must be observed that the
general character 01 the work corresponds in no way with what we
should expect from the account given 01 Probus by Suetonius (Ill.
Gramm. 24), according 10 which it was almost entirely to questions
01 grammar aud criticiem that he devoted his attention. The re-
mains 01 Probus' commentary on Virgil which have been preserved
by later writers bear 0111, as will have been seen from the specimens
which I have quoted, the observatiou 01 Suetonius. Very few 01 them
touch on questions 01 history or antiquities: one only, 00 Aen. 1018
(“hominum divumque aeterna potestas ”), contains matter 010 quasi-
philosophica] character. Now if there is one thing noticeable about the
commentary on the Eclogues and Georgius which bears the name 01
Probus, it 10 that it is coucemed almost entirely with points 01 mytho-
logy, history, geography‚ and theosophy. Nor cau 110 quality 00 0
