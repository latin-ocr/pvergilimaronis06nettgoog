work which was read by Virgil, or the more cautious speculation of
Colonel Mure‚² who refers 1110 unincorporated fragments to some 01
the lost poema traditionally ascribed 10 Ηο01011, such 00 tho Astrouomy
and the Maxime 01 01101100. Possibly Ρ101101111101 may bave bean
thinking 01 these when he addressed Virgil as repeating in song the
directions 01 the old Ascraean bard, and tolling of the plain in which
the corn-crop grows greenest the slope 00 which tho grape clusters
best, though it 10 equally likely that he simply intended 10 00110011·
ledge 1110 Georgica as a Hesiodic poem, characterizing them, not by
any thing in Hesiod, but by their own argument as summed up in 1110
exordium of the First Book. In any case, however, we may be sure
that what we have lost beers no proportion in velue, aa a means 01
estimating the 10101100οο1 Hesiod and virgil, 10 what we have pre·
served. The recovery 01 the whole 01 Hesiod’s poetry would doubtless
supply us with illustratione of many passages in the Georgica: itis not
needed to indicate and sbadow forth, though it might possibly deepen,
tbe contrast between the poet 01 Angustan Rome and 11011011-11111111001

The Works and Days are the earliest classioal representative 01 that
species of poetry which is known as tho Didacticp a variety which has
been extensively cultivated in later times, and may be said to bavo
flourisbed in England down to the end 01 tho last century. Yet it is
001100 much to 000011110100011011110111011011 10 justify the 1110101001
with which diductio poetry 10 regarded by 1110 writers aud readers of tho
present day might find his strougest arguments in an examination 01
Hesiod's poem, not by attempting to derogato from its characteristic
excellences, but by using it 00 0 witness to show that the class oi com·

Colone] Mure is not exceeding bis customary modesty 01 theorizing
when 110 delivers itas his 0111111011111014 “ had prose composition been
already popular in Hesiod‘s time, the Works and Days would probably
have been embodied in that form.'' It is indeed obviously the product

speech which it must bave seemed impossible to invest with any artistic
