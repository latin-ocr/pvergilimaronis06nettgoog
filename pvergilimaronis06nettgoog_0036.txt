Witheut quoting all the instantes 01 novel refiuement in lauguage
given in Macrobius, we are, Ι think, justified iu asserting that there
were a number 01 expressions in Virgil which were felt to require
defense 01 explanation. Thst Macrobius had in his hands some work
01 werke in which they were attached, or, at least, remarked upon,
may be inferred 110111 two facts. First, it will he observed that in at
100011001011110110100 above quoted, he seems to be giving the actual
words 01 an adversaryz I mean those on Aen. 7. 417, 6. 204, 4. 514
(here the words are now mutilated), aud 10. 716. Secondly, the
criticisms 1011 roughly under heads, though Macrobius does net say 00.

gregis, aquae 100110, telorum 00000, ferreae irater. Then comes 0 mention
01 001110 expressions 1101 easily reduceable under any particular head, 00
Dono 1011010100 Cereris: and, finally,a note on Virgil‘s 1100 01 one word
101 another, 00 0νο 101 perennes.

Supposing the whole passage to bc au extract 110111 001110 collection
01 such expressions, these two 10010 will be easily explained. A cem·
parison 01 the notes given in parallel columns will, I think, show that
the Servius 01 the Saturnalia stands in 110 relation 01 dependence 10
the real Servius. The real Servius is sometimes silent where Macrobius
has a note; sometimes 110 is fuller, sometimes 1000 1011 than Macrobins;
sometimes he seems 10 be deiending Virgil against an objection3 some.
times his remark adds something 11011, 01 10 altogether different. At
the same time, thesemo passages are, ou the whole, commented on in
beth3 and 111101001, when put together with 1110101 the discrepancies
just noticed, points to the conclusion that hethere ultimately derived
110111 the same source.

To this source, whatever it was, we may, perhaps, owe the following
notes iu 1110 commentary bearing the name 01 Serviusz-Aen. 77. 7,
