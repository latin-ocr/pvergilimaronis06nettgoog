Tur possible relation of this part 01 Virg.’s work to the Μελισσουργικά 01 matus,
and the position which it may bs said to occupy with reference tc the presiding oon·
ception oi the Georgics as the poetical glorificationes labour, have each of them
been touched upon in the general Introduction. As 0 didactio 11001100, the Fourth
Book is perhaps more regular than the rest; that is, 11 we consider it to include not
only the “ experience ” 01 the bes-keeper, but, according to Dryden's somewhat bold
rendering oi “experientia” the “birth and genius ” 01 the bec. There are however
two memorable digressione, the one apologizing ior the absence 01 0 disquisition ou
gardening es a constituent part of the Georgics and containing a 1101100010 visit
once pald by the poet to an old gardener ut Tarentum (vv. llo-148), the other
tracing the Eastern method of breeding bees ont oi the carcases of cattle to a sup·
pcsed legendary origin in the Grecian story 01 Aristaeus (vv. 315-158). On the
first 1 have offered some remarks in a note on the lines concluding it: on the second
something remeius to be said.

'I'redition tells us 11101 the story 01 Aristaeus did not originally form part oi 11110
book, which, es flrst written, had a very different conclusion. [Serv. on E. 10.1
saysel the poet Cornelius Gallus, “ fuit autem amicus Vergilii adeo ut quartus
Georgicorum a melio usque ad finem eins laudes teneret, quas postea iubente
Augusto in Aristaei fabulam commutavit:” and repeats this story on (1.4. 1.]
Heyne discredits this, seeing nothing in the subject 01 the book which could have
suggested so elaborate a commemoration 01 Gallus: but 11 we accept Keightley's
ingenious suggestion that the mention 01 Egypt as the country where tire art of
restoring bees wesin vogne (vv. 287 foll.) may have led to an eulcgy on the friend
who had followed up the victory of Actium, assisted Octavianus in securing (1100·
petra, aud was in consequence mede the first prefect of the new province, we shall
see that the elementoi infernal probability is not wanting, at the same time that we
shall be able, as Keigbtley remarks, 10 0000001 101 0 certain appearance 01 topo-
graphical overloading in the lines where Egypt is designated. Bo again the oir-
cumstances 01 Gallus’ iall, which was owing to the alleged extravagant assumption
01 his Egyptian administration, may show us that, without wishing to war with
the dead, Caesar may haye naturally desired the suppression of so elaborate an
encomium on acareer which ended so disastrously. Koightley apparently thinks
that the passage extended only to a few lines, which were easily removed, though
not without leaving a rent: l see no difficulty in taking the tale cn its intrinsic
likeiihood 00 11 stands, and supposing that the episcde 01 Gallus may have been as
considerable in its range and pretension as tho episcde 01 Aristaeus. We bave secu
