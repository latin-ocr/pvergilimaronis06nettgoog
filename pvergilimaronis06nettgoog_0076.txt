each other, and dealing with precisely thesemo subject, aud to a con-
siderable extent using the same instaures. The first of these begins l,
p. 378, beginning ct the words “ et ex his quaedam eadem voce utrumque
significant, id est actionem et passionem.‘’ After giving oue or two
instances of such verbs, aud a few of ordinary deponente, Priscian pro-
ceeds, “ex his multu antiqui tam activa quam passiva significatione
protulisse inveniuntur,” and then gives a list which is on the whole
alphabetical from the letter a to o: auxilior, adminicnlor, auguror, ad-
hortor, apieacr, abominor, consequor, amplector, adorior, abutor, admiror,
antester, mereator, aspernor, architector, assentur, argumentor, reor, uerear,
solor, arbitror, blandior, consolor, conspicor, comminiscor, complector,
calumnior, carnificor, despicor, demolior, dominor, depeculor, delargior,
ementior, exordior, superior, frustror, hortor, sor, meditor, obliviscor, and
then metm aud adulor. Instances from classical authors are theu
quoted of the following verbs: auxilior, adulor, adminiculor, adlmrtor,
auguror, apiscar, abominor, consequar, amplector, complector, adorior,
abutor, admiror, testor, antester, exsecror, machinor, polliceor, adgredior,
aepemor, architector, adsentor, argumentor, arbitror, blandior, consolor,
conspicor, comminiscor, consequor, contestor, carnanter, ccruplector, calum
nior, carnificor, dignor, detestor, despicor, donaolim, meditor, derainer,
depecnlor, delaryior, ementior, exordior, experior, frustror, tortor, sor,
obliviscor, nector, tutor, undar, aanor, ueliflcor, caederer, ueneror.

It is to be observed that the list in which the words are illustrated
by exemplos, although it purports to be identical with the uuillustrated
list, is not entirely so. The lists with exemplos is fuller andalao
more strictly alphabetical than the other: adulor, for instance, occurs
in its place among verbs beginning with a. Tho three words reor, uereor,
and solor, which interrupi the alphabetical order in the first list, recur
in the second, but without any instances. The impressiou left on my
mind after reading the two lists is, that the author of the first had copied
from the author of the second, but not quite accurately in respect of
the arrangement. Iu other words, that Priscian is making extracta
from two manuale, both of which depeud on a common source.

After some further remarks ou the confusion of voices, in which ou
p. 391 the beginning of a fresh alphabetical list is quoted from Caper
(adiutor—delapidar), Priscian, on p. 392, starts the subject again with
another long list which is in the main alphabetical: testa, opino, cuncto,
concino, contanplo, amicalo, cammaro, ancilia, auguro, auspice, carantonia,
arimino, malie, diano, eaecro, epula aiulo, lucto, luctito, luciaria, laeta,
ludifico, misereo. These words are given without any instaures: and
then follow some more which are illustrated from classical authors:
torta, largio, aucupa, alterco, medico, amplam, amplecto, aonmlecto. Oi
these usages, Priscian adds, examples may be found in Pliny (that is,
