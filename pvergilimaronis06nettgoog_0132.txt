12 BUOOLIOA.

isa shepherd because he is a poet, his friends, as being poete themselves,
or at least friends oi a poet, must be shepherds too, and the times upon
which he has fallen must be described by pastoral images. Qssusr the
soldier and elegiae poet, already introduced among the heroes of mytho·
logy in the sixth Eclogne, appears in the tenth as the dying shepherd of
Theocritus, languishing under the shelter oi a rock, and consoled hythe
rural gods; he is at the same moment in Italy and in Arcadia, acting
with Octavianus against Sex. Pompeius, and bewailing his lost love in
the ears oi ideal swains. Whatever may be the ultimate source of the

inspiration which animates the fourth Eelogue, and whoever the child
shadowed forthae the king oi the peaceful world, the poem is evidently
a description of the new era supposed to be inaugurated in Pollio's con-
sulship by the peace oi Brundisinm; but the golden age is represented

as a golden age oi pastoral life, where art is to be nothing and nature
every thing, a recollection oi the legendary past in Hesiod converted
into au anticipation oi the historical future. So the Daphnis oi the
fifth Eclogne is evidently the great Julius, aethe similarity of the
images to those in the preceding poem is sufficient tc show; it isa
pastoral poet that celebrates him, and therefore be must be celebrated as
a shepherd, wept by all nature in his death, powcrinl and honoured as a
rnral god in his immortality. Even where the poems appear at first
sight to be purely dramatic and impersonal, the poet is still visible.
Menalcas, an actor in the fifth Eclogue, announces himself at the end of
it as the author of the second and third3 in the ninth an intimation is
made from which we infer that the fifth also is really at work, the song
of Mopsus no less than his own. The second Eclogue is one which we

should gladly believe to be purely ideal, instead ol shifting the tradition ’ ·

which professes to verify it: nor need we be anxious to think with
Servius that the song oi Silenus to the shepherds is really an epicurean
lecture delivered by Siron to his pupils. But when we find shepherds
rivalling each other for tbe favour of Pollio, and lampooning Bavins
and Maevius, we feel that jealousy ior the poet's credit as a painter oi
life is rather a misplaced sentiment.⁸

It is as an artist that Virgil appears chiefly to challenge onr admira-
tion, as iubis other werke, so also in the Bncolics. The language, in-
deed, which he puts inte the months of his pastoral personages is for

⁸ Ii may be said that in Milton's Lycidas the Virgilian confusion oi shepherd and
poet ie turned into mere chaos bytho introduction oi a third clement, the Christian
shepherd or minister. Tharais, however, this differeuca that the olvjeot, no less
than the effect, oi the poem is not to describe pastoral life, but to paint student life
in pastoral colonrs. The tenth Eclogue might take the beneflt of the same distine-
tion, if we eculd separate it ln our judgment from the rest. Milton's use oi
mythology might afford another ground for comparison with virgil: bui the subject
is too large ior a note
