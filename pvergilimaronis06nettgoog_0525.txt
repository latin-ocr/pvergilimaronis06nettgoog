GEORGIGON LIB. IV. 405

Quiriti nuno viridis depascunt summa Lycaei,

Delige, et intaeta totidem eerviee iuveneas. 54⁰
Quattuor his aras alta ad delubra dearum

Constitue, et sacrum iugulis demitte eruorem,
Corporaque ipsa boum frondoso desere lueo.

Post, ubi nona suos Aurora ostenderit ortus,

Inferias Orphei Lethaea papavera mittes, 545
Et nigram mactabis ovem, lucumque revises.
