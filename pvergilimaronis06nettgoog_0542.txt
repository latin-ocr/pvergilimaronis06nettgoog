422 ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LATER DIDAOTIO POETS OF ROME.

Aut caprae fimus et bulbi, aut cervina medulla:
Hoc etiam immotos flectes medicamine nervos
Quos autem vocitant tolles, attingere dextra
Debebis, qua gryllus erit pressante peremptus.”

Still more barren and unpoetical is Prisciani samen de Poeante
et Memoris, aset oi 208 hexameters, the authorship oi which isinvolved
in some doubt. The first nine linos will show that in spite of a pre-
liminary flourish, it is little better than a memoria technica, a device
ior fixing facts about weights and messores in the memory.

‘⁴ Pondere Paeoniis veterum memorata libellis
Nosse iuvat. Pondus rebus natura locavit
(torporem elementa snum regit omnia pondus.
Pondere terra manet: vacuus quoqne ponderis aether
indefessa rapit volventia sidera mundi.
Ordiar a minimis, post haec maiora sequentur:
Nam maius nihil est aliud qnam multa minuta
Semioboli duplum est obolus, quem pondere duplo

Ι Gramma vocant, scriplum nostri dixere priorcs.''

Here at length we may stop. The didactic poetry with which we
have been dealing, though iar enough removed from the spirit oi the
Georgica, has at any rate preserved their form. Terentianus -Manrns
may have been as machoi a didactio poet as Sammonicus or the sup·
posed Priscian3 but as he chose to exemplify in his work the various
matres ior which he laid down rulers, he can hardly come under con-
sideration in an essay which is intended to illustrate by comparison
the didactic poetry oi Virgil. Other works which the historiens oi
Latin literature have classed among didactic poems seem to be ex·
clnded by different reasons. The Ptoerwmenc oi Avienus, like the
fragments of Cicero and Germanicus, hardly calls for notice inde· ,
pendently of Aratus’ work. The poem on Aetna has didactio affinities,
but its subject is not sufficiently general. The Perieyesee oi Avienus
and Priscian fall rather under the category of descriptive poetry.
Columella’s Tenth Book has been mentioned in another place.⁸
