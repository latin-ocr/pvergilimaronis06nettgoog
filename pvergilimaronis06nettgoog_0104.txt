c THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

the comesponding note in Nonius p. 331. It may fairly be said that
wherever the Verona scholia bave boen preserved, it ie the first duty
of a modern commentator to consult them. Readme who have
followed thie eseay so far will have already derived some notion of the
quality of the Verona scholia from the quotations made in the sections
on Asper and Velius Longus: and they have been cited in the course
of the commentary wherever any light is to be derived from them.
Whether these scholia were compiled before the time of Donatus
and Servius or not, their composition cannot be dated earlier than the
last part of the third century aa, as they mention Haterianus. The
fact that the names of Servius and Donatus never occur in them ie, so
far as it goes, an argument in favour of supposing what their general
character lcads us to presumo, that they were written before those

commentatore appear on the scene

AELIUS DONATUS.

This scholar, whom J erome mentione more than once as his teacher‚
lived aad taught in the middle of the fourth century at Rome, where
he held the poet of orator erbis Romae and the title of air clarissimae.
It is unfortunate that we know nothing of his commentary on Virgil
but what we learn from the remarks, mostly polemical, of Servius.
He prefixed to his commentary the Life of VirgiJ which scholare aro
now agreed was the work of Suetonius.l This lact, as well as the
character of bie commentary on Terence, would have led ne to expect
a work of eonnd scholarehip from Aelius Donatus: yet, if we may
believe Servius, he was weak both in knowledge and in jndgment.
On A. 2. 798, for instance, he seems to have expreseed an opinion
that ee Ilio might stand as a metrical equivalent for exilia he thought
that citae (A. 8. 642) could=divieae5 that litas (A. 2. 557) could
mean a spot before the altar, and could be derived from litare ; that
Amsanctus (A. 7. 563) was in Lucania3 that “trahunt in moenia”
(A. 12. 585) conld mean “dilacerant in moenibus,” and so on. It is
difficnlt to suppose that the bnlk of his commentar-y was not of better
quality than thie. Eri-ors like those just mentioned (and Servius him·
self is not entirely gniltless of such mistakee) only show how surely
the decline of scholarehip had est in by the middle of the fourth
century aa, and indeed (if the work of Nonius may he taken as a
specimen) much earlier.
