INTRODUOTION. 139

mitting to a dispensation in which those who would live must labour,
is identical with the lesson which he draws from his briefer view 01 the
legendary antiqnities 01 his subject. The description 01 the plough is
110111 Hesiod, though the later poet, in spite 01 his evident anxiety 10
attain exactness 01 (111111, does not come ap 10 the fulness 01 the earlier.
The very meagreness of Virgil’s paragraph about the lucky and unlucky
days, whether it be true or no that tho precise substance 0111 is
1101101111110111111011111111110151111] induce us to surmise that he would
not have given a paragraph to the subject at all, but for his deference
1ο the example 01 Hesiod. 'I'he famous sturm-pisce in the Georgics was
evidently suggested by the winter-piece in the Works and Days‚ both ,
being introduced to warn the farmcr 01 the dangers to which he is liable
in his calling, while each is evidently intended by its authores a
specimen 01 elaborate description, nt the same time that it is carious
to contrast Virgil’s rapid enumeration of the more striking features of
the scene, the continuans burst 01 rain, the levelling 01 the crops, the
swelling 01 torrent and sea, the flashing 01 the lightning, the terror of
man and beust, the fall 01 the mountain peak, and tho howling 01 the
wind, with the Dutch fidelity 01 drawing with which Hesiod repre·
sented a single point, the effect 01 the sleet ou the animals, how it
pierces some and iails to pierce others, and how the wilder sort scud
to their dens, like an old man moving on three legs, with his back
rather broken than bent, and his head looking down 1ο the ground.
Not less instructive is' the parallel between the two poete iu the lines
where they spcak 011110 coming in 01 the warm westher, “when
lambs and goats are at their fattest, aud wine at its mellowest.¹’
Mr. Rnskin might appeal to the sequel of the passage in Hesiod, the
wisb for a sheltering rock, and wine 01 Biblos, and a cuke raised by
yeast, and goat’s milk, and the flesh 01 a cow that has not yet calved,
and of firstling kids, as a proof of the 1111011111101111111101101111)1
feeling of the picturasque in the early Greek mind to a sense 01 phy»
sicul comfort3 while it would be only just to note that Virgil, in talking
of the pleasure 01 mid-day sleep, and of the thickness 01 the shadowing
foliage on the mountains, has at any rate omitted the grosser and more

purely corporeal accessories 01 meat and drink. Virgil may be said
also to follow Hesiod in his natural calendar, generally fixing the
time 01 the year by the rising or setting oi some star, and onoc or
twice noting the return 01 a season by the return 01 a bird, such as the
stork or the swallow. As in the Eclogues, the stutely march 01 his
diction has in it nothing 01 agricultural simplicity3 yet there aro
instances in which he has imitated the proverbial quaintness 01 some 01
