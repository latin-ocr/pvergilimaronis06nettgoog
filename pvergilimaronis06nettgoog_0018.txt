reaped by Heyns; but Ι found that he had left me something to
glean. From (leuda in particular, whose own complete com·
mentary I have sometimes consulted, Ι have derived some ad·
ditional parallel passages, though he is fond of accumulating

matter which is not strictly relevant. Trapp's notes, appended to
his translation, are not without good sense, but do not show much
learning or poetical feeling. Martyn‘s commentary has been con·
stantly at my side, and has been of some use, independently of its
botanical and agricultural information, as containing the opinions
of others, particularly Gatrou, whose own edition I have never
seen. Heyne's explanatory notes deservo much of the pmice they
have received, but they are deficient in minute attention to the
author's language. I have used Voss's commentary on the
Eclogues (in Reinhardt's Latin translation) with advantage, fre-
quently availing myself of his research even where I could not
accept his views ; his commentary on the Georgics I have un·
fortunatcly been unable to procura, though I have no reason to
believe that it is an uncommon book. The explanatory notes of
Wagner are few, though more numerous than those of Spohn aud
Wunderlich, which he has incorporated in his edition of Heyne;
they are however generally valuable, while his “ Quaestiones Vir·
gilianae'' exhibit very great care and diligence. The merits of
. Forbiger’s edition are chiefly those of a compilation 3 but it oon·
taius alarge amount of exegetical matter; it leaves few difficulties
unnoticed; aud its references to grammars and other works where
points of language are examined deservo much commendation.
I have made great use of it, levying on it the same kind of
contributione which it has levied on others. 'lo Mr. Keightley
Ι owe a more personal acknowledgment, as he was kind enough,
when Iwas preparing my first edition, tc place in my hands a
copy of his Notas on the Eclogues and Georgica, containing
many MS. corrections and additions, aud also to favour me with
his opinion on certain points by letter. His book has been chiefly
useful to mein relation to agricultural and botanical matters, but
I have derived ‹musidcrabls advantage from his independent
judgment asa general commentator, though frequently compelled
to differ from him on questions of scholarship. From Ladewig’s
German school commentaryss speak of the first edition only)I
