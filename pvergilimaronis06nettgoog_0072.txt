lxviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTITORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

RELIGS OF COMMENTARIES PRESIIRVIID IN THII “Du
COMPENDIOSA DOCTRINA ’² OF NONIUS.

Istrongly suspect that a greum many 01 the observations made by
Probus in his commentarios on ancient usage, 11 well as other remeius
of the work of scholare 01 11111111101111111111,1111)1 be recovered
from later writers, and notubly from Nonius Marcellus, the 11011 known
African scholar of the third century. The De Gompecdioca Doctrina 01
Nonius is 1 medley 01 mutilated scholarship which, 101 the sake 01

convenience, we may distribute under three hands: first, lexicographi-
cal: Books Ι. ΙΙ. IV. V. VI, and part 01 XII 3 second, grammatical:

Books ΠΙ. VII. VIII. IX. X. XI. and part 01 ΧΙΙ.; third, antiquarian:
Books XIII-XX.l ·’

01 the lexicographical and antiquarius books I could, did space per-
mit, show that much is ultimately due to Verrius Flaccus, although I
suspect that it came to Nouius through the hands 01 other scholare,
auch as Caesellius Vindex, and Suetonius. The fourth book (De Vario
Sipaifccctiorw Verborum), which occupies more thau 1 third of the
whole treatise, and is 1110 iu point 01 matter the most importent part
oi it, is remarkable for the enormous number of quotatious from
Virgil which it contains. It may indeed be said without exaggeration
that there are very few articles in this section in which Virgil is not
quoted. 'Ibis 1101 seems to point to the conclusion that the writer,
whoever he was, from whose works the fourth book 01 Nonius was
taken, wasa great student 01 Virgil, as well as (in his way) 1 lexico·

graBpriliiii the ease 01 the grammatical books 01 Nonius, we ean g'o further,

‘It should be observed that the opening remarks ou the supposed origin 01
bucolic poetry are iu substance identioul with those 01 Diomedes, p. 488 1011, and
also with those 01 Servius at the beginning 01 his commentary. Now the whole
1101101101 Diomedes iu which these observatious occur is supposed by Keil (and
very plausibly) 10 come from Suetonius. If tbis be the case, the commentary attri-
buted to Probus is at once stamped as spurious.

Tha grammatioal heatises (0111011001 and Instituta Artiaca) which bear the name
01 Probus 111 not now, so 111 11 1 know, attributed by any scholar to Probus 01
Berytus: see Keil's prefaoe to tbe fourth volume 01 his Gramnwts'ci Latini.

² The antiquity 01 the authorities followed by N ouius is sufficieutly established
by the single fact that, with 10111 01 dre exceptione, he quotes nc author 01 later
date thau the Augustan nge.
