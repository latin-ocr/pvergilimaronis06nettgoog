TO THE SEGOND EDITION. xv

have gained something, though his novelties of interpretation
seem to me frequently uutrue, and his oonjectural deviatione from
the received text unfortunate. Ι have 'consulted also the school
editions by Mr. A. H. Bryce aud Mr. 0. D. Yonge, and parts of a
critique by Ameis on passages iu Wagner's and Ladewig'e editions
of the Eclogues and Georgica, under the title of “spicilegium
explicationem Vergilianarum.” Ι am sorry that I am obliged to
go to prees before the appearance of Dr. Kennedy's promised
school edition.

I have carefully studied the valnable review of the first edition
of this volume by my friend ΜΓ. Mauro, in the Journal of Clas·

, sicel and Sacred Philology, frequently adopting his views, aud
g never rejecting them without full consideration. And I have

introduced not a few suggestions from a body of remarks kindly
forwerded to me by Mr. Blackburn‚ Reetor of Selham in Sussex,
who speaks not only as a student of Virgil, but as a man aecus·
tomed to country pursuits. While, however‚I trust that from
these and other sources various improvements will be discovered
in the explanatory part of the present edition, it is right to say
that it will be found to be substantially unaltered.

As subsidiary works, bearing on the subject of the Georgica,
I have consulted Dickson’s “Husbandry of the Ancients‚” and
Dr. Daubeny’s reeently published “Lectures on Roman Hus-
bandry ; '’ but my knowledge has, Ι fear, not been always sufficient
to enable me to use them with effect The grammar to which
I have most frequently referred is Madvig’s3 the lexicon, For·
cellini's.

Tho editions of the classics to which 1 have referred have been
ingeneral the best and latest, when my library happened to con·
tuin them. For the Greek dramatists I have followed Dindorf ;
for Pindar, Bergk or Schneidewiu; for Hesiod, commonly Gottling3
for Dion Cassius, Reimarus; for Xenophon and Appian, the edi·
tions published in Teubner’s series. For Plautus‚I have followed
those editions where the lines are numbered by Acts and Scenes,
not as preferring that practice, which appears not to have been
sanctioned by antiquity, but because neither Ritschl nor Fleckeisen,
who adopt the other plan, has completed his edition; for Pro·
pertine, Paley; for Lucretius, Lachmaun3 for the other Latin
