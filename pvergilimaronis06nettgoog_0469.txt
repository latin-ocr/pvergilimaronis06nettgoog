Ingentis animos angusto in pectore versant,
Usque adeo obnixi non cedere, dum gravis aut hos
Aut hos versa fuga victor dare terga subegit. 85

Verum ubi ductores acie revocaveris ambo,
Deterior qui visus, eum, ne prodigus obsit,
Dede neci 3 melior vacua sine regnet in aula ’ eo
Alter erit maculis auro squalentibus ardens3
