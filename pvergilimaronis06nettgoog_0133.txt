INTRODUCTION. 13

the most part as undramatio as the thoughts which that laugnage ex·
presses are conventioual and unreel. Iu a very few instances he attempta

to produce an appearance oi rusticity by sn archaism, a proverb, a cou-
versationsl ellipse, a clumsy circumlocution⁴; even there, however, be
seems to be copying Theocritus, rather than following the nature which
he had seen around him, sud the strain iu which his shepherds usually
converse is scarcely less elaborate than the ordinary diction of the Geor·
gios or the Aeneid. So in the practice oi the Greek poets the bucolic
hexameter hed a structure oi its own⁸2 as handled by Virgil it does not

differ from the didactic or the epie. Yet a more poetical people than
the Romans might be pardoued it they forgot their sense of dramatic
propriety in the delight with which they welcomed such specimens oi

langnage and versification as those which the Eulogues every where
exhibit. The tedicus labour of the file, the absence of which is deplored
by Horace⁶ ss fatal to the excellence of Roman poetry, hed at last

⁴ See Gebauer's ‘De Poetarum Graecorum Bucolicorum, imprimis Theocriti, Gar-
miuibus in Eologis a Vergilio adumbratis, Libri Duo’ (Leipsic, 1861), pp. 8f011.,a
valuable monograph, oi which 1 believe only the first volume has yet appeared. ι

There is a passage in Wycherley’s recommendstory lines on Pope's Pastorals
which is worth quoting, not only ior its own ingenuity, but as expressing the view
taken by Pope and his friends ol the langnage in which pastoral poetry should be
written—a view probably not very unlike Virgil's own, motulis mutandis

“Like some fair shepherdess, the silvan Musa
Should wear those flowers her native flelds produce, ·
And the true measure oi the shepherd's wit
should, lilre his gerb, be ior the country fit:
Yet must hie pure and unaffeoted thought
More nlcely than the common swain's be wrought:
So with beoomiug art the player's dress
In silke the shepherd and the shepherdess,
Yet still anchanged the form and mode romain,
Shaped like the hemely russet of the swain.''

See also Pope's discourse on Pastoral Poetry, prefixed to his Pastorals, where lre

lays down practioal rules for bucolic writing, and his bonical comparison of his own ·

Pasterais with Philips' (Guardisn No. 40), where the doctrine thet shepherds ought
to deal in proverbe is not lorgotten.

⁵ See Gebauer, pp. 70 loll, where too much is perhaps made oi the instaures—-
not more than 240 lines out of the whole number-in which the bucolic caesura is
preserved. It is evident that Virgil set no storo by it whatever as a necessary law
oi composition: that he should have employed it in the Eclognes more frequently
than iu the other two meme. is uo more than is natural in a young writer just
beginning to form his versificatiou, and at the time familiar with the cadence oi
Theocritus. (iebsuer, however, has done good service in' pointing out throughout
his work instsnoes in which virgil, without distinctly imitating Theocritus, has
when a bint lrom him in lunguage or versificatiou. Such inquiries are apt to seem
tedicusly minute: but they cannot be sal'ely overlooked by any one who would
really appreciata the art oi such a writer as virgil.
