GEORGIOON LIB. IV. 357

Addidit, expediam, pro qna mercede, cancros leo
Curetum sonitus crepitantiaque aera secutae,

Dictaeo caeli regem pavere sub antro.

Solae cummunis natos, consortia tecta

Urbis habent, magnisque agitant sub legibus aevum,

Et patriam solae et certos novere penates, 165
Venturaeque hiemis memores aestate laborem
Experiuntur etin medium quaesita reponunt. ,
