INTRODUCTION.

Tus student of Virgil may be said tc enjoy a singular advantage in the
preservation of those works of Greek poetry which his author professes
to have imitated. A few fragments are all that is leit of that glorious
body of lyric song which, aiter having been the delight ol Graece, while
Greece was yet a nation, lived again at Rome in the Odes of Horace,
inspiring their spirit and dictating their metre. Still more ecantyis
our knowledge ol the poems which are supposed to have served as
models for Ovid’s Metamorphoses, such as the Hesiodio Ἠοῖοιι1 or the
Ἑτεροιούμενα oi Nicander. Not only may we suppose that we have lost
the key to many thoughts, images, and phrases, which the possession of
the Greek would heve enabled us to clear up, but the whole relation of
the Latin poems to their originale becomes a matter of inference and
ol regne conjectura. But iu possessing Theocritus, Hesiod, and Homer,
we may feel that we possess, as it were, the cxciting causes oi the
Eclogues, the Georgica, aud the Aeneid. They do not indeed represent
all the literary influances which must have told upon Virgil's genius,
or disclose to us the origin of the peculias manner in which hc has
conducted the work of imitation: bnt they show us what it was that
in each successive case first stimulated his general conceptiones his
subject—what it was that he admired in the literature ol Grecos, and
sought to reprodnce among his own countrymen: they enable us to
’ judge oi him not only ab a poet, hut as a critic oi the poetry of others.

With regard to Hesiod, indeed, there is considerable reason to doubt
whether we possess the whole of what Virgil set himself to copy.

Various agricultural precepta are cited from Hesiod—ior instance, .

about the culture oi the olive and the vine—which find no place in the
Works and Daye, as we now read them; and though some of these
may be disposed ol hythe consideration that the name of Hesiod was
often loosely applied to any thing which might iall under the head of
rural didactios, enough remeius of a more strictly Hesiodio character

to render some other hypothesis necessary-whether it be the popular
German theory that the extant Works and Daye, interpolated ae the
same authority pronouuces them to be, represent only a part of the
