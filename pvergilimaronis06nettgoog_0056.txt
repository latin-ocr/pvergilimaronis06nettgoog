lii VIRGIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITIOS.

blamed for want 01 invention in his incidente, or for observing a wrong
order and adopting an artificial style in his catalogues, or for iorgetful
repetitions 01 110 same name, or inconsistency in his narrative, or
divergeuce from Homer, or false teste, or bad mythology, or other
minor faults akin to these (pp. xxxvii.—xliii.); (3) those in which Virgil
10 declared 10 have fallen below Homer in similar and other passages
borrowed from him (pp. xliv. xlv.); (4) those in which heis charged
with ignorauce of religione antiquities (p. 1. foll).

Nowif Iam right in aaying that these criticisms are expressed in
the same venomous bnt idiomatic style; ii it be true, as itis so far asI
have observed, that they are all directed against passages in the Aeneid
(the only exception is an apparent one, Macrob. 3. 11. 1, where Georg.
1. 344 is quoted; but this is instantly followed by aline from the
eighth Aeneid: ic octco0)—it is natural to infer that they come from
the Aeacidomaetia of Carvilius Pictor, which 4 is quoted by Servius on
Aen· 5. 521.

Besides this, two other works of hostile criticism are mentioned by
Suetonius: the citio of Herennius aud the farto of Perellius Faustus.

It is possible, though Ι do not like to say more, that the criticisms
quoted 011 p. xxx. 1011. were taken from the work of Herennius. As to
the farta, it is very difficnlt 10 pronounce with any amount of assurance
what was the scope and extent of the work. It may or may not have
included collectione of Virgil’s plagiarisms from Homer and the Greeks,
as well as of passages taken from Latin authors. But I am inclined
in auy case to suspect that the passages from Latin authors collected
in the sixth book 01 Macrobius came directly or indirectly from this
work. It is remarkable that in this book there are apologetic remarks
on the propensity 01 110 ancient writers to steal from one another: 1.

hunc esse fructum legendi, aemulari ea quaein aliis probes,” dc. Com·
pare 6. 2. 33, “nec Tullio compilando, dummodo undique ornamenta

sibi conferret, abstinuit ”2 a hostile remark admitted inadvertently‚ 00 .

00 often, by Macrobius into a context where it is out of place. Now
these general remarks about plagiarism would have been better
in place at the head of the passages from Homer collected in the fifth
book: and Ι am tempted therefore to suppose that they were suggested
by observatione on this question which Macrobius found in the works

from which he got the instances quoted in Book VI. This work may
or may not have been the farta of Perellius Faustus. But it seems in
any 0000 10 have been a work which Servius did not much use, for
(except in the case 01 Ennius) he quotes from [atinauthors mainly for
the purpose 01 grammatical, or historical, or philosophical illustration. ’
