The Medicean and the Palatius contain many correctione, partly
from the hands 01 the copyiets who wrote them, partly from othere of a
not much later date. But did our text of Virgil depend on any 00001
110 0001010, 11 would be full 01 corruptions. To take another instance,
what can be worse than the error 01 Pal. in Georgia 2. 315, persuadit
0000110 for persuadeat caetori Fortunately, however, the errore of
one manuscript 000 01100 10 corrected by the readings 01 another, or
by the light 01 testimony afforded by the ancient commentatore and ‘
grammarians.

1 have already endeavoured 10 show that much 01 110 material col-
lected by Servius, Philargyrins, and the writers of the Verona and
Berne scholia is ultimately derived from writings belonging to the
first or carly second century 10. 11 follows that where these com-
mentarios mention, as they not seldom do, readings which differ from
any 01 thoee given in our manuscripts, those readings may very pro·
bably be entitled at least to serious consideration. Instancee 01 thie
phenomenon are to 10 found in Georgia 1. 508, where the text known
to Nonius and the author (whoever he was) 01 Serviue' note cn Aen.
12. emmeramensem in Georgic 2. 177 110 text followed by Nonius
had 0100190010, 0 reading mentioned by Philargyriue3 in Georgic 3.
415, N onius and Servius read qravi nidore, not 900000 ; in Aen. 2. 62
Nonius read vereare dolo, not dolos, a variant mentioned by Servius.
In all these 00000, and many othere which are noticed in 1100001-
mentary, the commentatore approve or register 0 reading unknown
10 the manuscripts. In Aen. 7. 773 there can be no doubt that the
reading 01 Probus, Phoebigenam, is 10 10 preferred to that 01 the
manuscripts.

Such variatione between the commentatore and the manuscripts add
10 110 probability 01 110 conclusion at which Ribbeck has arrived on
other grounds, that our manuscripts are ultimately derived from one
archetype, itself, no doubt, inll 01 variants and corrections, but repre·
senting a text different from that followed, in some 00000, by the
authority or authorities from whom the notes common 10 Nonius,
Servius, and the other ancient commentatore, are derived. Tc decide
