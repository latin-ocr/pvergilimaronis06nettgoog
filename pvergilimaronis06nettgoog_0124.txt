coniound worse the confusion which blended Sicily aud the Maitona

district into one, and identified Julius Caesar with that Daphnis whom
the nymphs loved, and whose death drew groans from the lions.

There is something almost unexampled iu the state ei feeling which
at Rome and in the Augustan age in particular, allowed palpable aud
avowed imitation to claim the honours oi poetical originality. Pacuvius
and Accius are praised not ior having called ont the tragedy which lies,
patent rather than latent, in Roman history and Roman life, nor even
ior having made the legends which they derived from Greece the sub-
ject of original dramas oi their own, but specifically ior having applied⁸
their wit to the writings oi the Greeks, as to so much raw material, aud
adapted to the Reman stage the entertainments which had alternately
, delighted aud terrified the populace oi Athens. Horace invites atten-
tion to himself,⁹ as an independent traveller along untrodden ground,
not as having discovered any measure peculiar to the Latin langnage‚
any melody to which the thoughts oi his countrymen would naturally
vibrate, but as having been the first to display to Latium the capabili·
ties oi the Archilochian Iambic, the Alcaic, aud the Sapphic. So Pro-
pertius¹ speaks oi Thyrsis and Daphnis, and the rustic presente which
shepherd makes to shepherdess‚ names and things copied· precisely from
Theocritus, asii they were actually a new world to which Virgil had
introduced him and his contemporaries of the grem city. Striking as
the pheuomenou is, the circumstances of the case enable us readily to
'account ior it. The Roman knew only oi a single instance of a national
literature in the world: it challenged his allegiance with an undisputed
claim, and his only course seemed to he to conform to it, and endeavour
so iar as he could, to reproduce it among his own people. It seems as
ii uo parallel to such a mental condition could exist in our larger
modern experieuce, where the very number oi the models set before ns
corrects our admiration by distractiug it, and forces us, as it were, in

Et post Punica bella quietus quaerere coepit

Quid Sophocles et Thespis et Aeschylus utile ferrent”
