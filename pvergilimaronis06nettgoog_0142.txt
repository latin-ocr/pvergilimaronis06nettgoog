22 P. VERGILI MARONIS

observari by the editors, who suppose Tityrus, like blaesis in Eeb 910110 Virgil’s
‘villicus' who goes to Rome 10 purehase bis liberty 01 his master, and there hears
from Octavianus that his meater's property is saie-a cumbrous hypothesis, and not
really reconcilable with the langnage 01 the Eclogue. The earlier commentatore,

v. 30, stand for Rome and 1100100 respectively. Trapp, in rejecting the allegory,
himself supposes that the change of partners is intended 10 10110010 a change of

coverne (v. 75), 1000010100 (0. 83), and rocks (vv. 15, 47, 56, ’16) belonging to Sicily,

Galatea, and Amaryllis, being borrowed from Theocritus.
