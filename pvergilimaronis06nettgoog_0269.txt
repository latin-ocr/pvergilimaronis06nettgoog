INTRODUGTION. 149

received the endowment of delicacy and artistic ekill from the Muses of
the country3 and the sentence which, in the mouth of ite author, was
merely the expression of a fact, has been accepted and repeated in later
times ae the announcement of a jndgment. Now that Virgil hae oeased
to he regarded aethe rival of Homer, it is common to represent him ae
the poet of rural life, who is to be estimated not by the ambitione task
which imperial vanity thrust upon hie manhocd‚ bnt by the more simple
and genial werke to which he turned of himself in the freehnese of youth.
Such is the view which is enforced by Mr. Keble in hie hectures on
Poetry.1 That which especially distinguishee virgil, it ie eloquently
maintained,is hie ardent and irrepreseible love of the country. Not
only isit theanimating eoulof the Eclognee and Georgics, bat it hennte
him throughout the Aeneid, venting itself in a number of half-melan·
choly retrospecta, and breaking ont into “a thousand eimilee.” He
seems scarcely to wish to make his hero interesting, bnt he ie never
tired of illustratiug epic situations hythe characteristic beautiee and
delicate proprieties of natural objecta. Nay, it is even suggested that
the event in his personal history which most markedly connects him
with the country,ie likely to have had a large share in determining the
character of his poetry. Anxiety about the safety of hie farm was one
of the presiding feelings in the compositiones the Ecloguse: the tender
recollection of the poet danger and of the soenes which he may have
afterwards revisited hovers over the Georgius: gratitnde for the pro·
tection extended tobim induced him to make a sacrifice of his truer
instincte, and undertake the Aeneid.

'I'o attempt a full discussion of thie opinion would be obviously pre·
sumptuone in one who ie consciens of hie own deliciencyin the power or
habit of appreciating external nature, and eo ie incapable of rightly
estimating those descriptive or allueive touchee which undoubtedly ap-
pear throughout Virgil's poenis. Such a one, however, may perhaps
be allowed to etate hie own impreesion with regard to the prominence of
the position which the feeling in question would seem to have occupied
in thepoet’e mindae unfolded in hie werke. ‘I'he choice of a subject
certainly furniehes a posted socie argument that thesubject, or some-
thing connected with it, hae been thought congenial by the chooser,
though we must not forget that Virgil himself speaks of kinge and
battlee aehaving heen the object ofhiefirst poetical aspiratione, referring,
eo tradition interprete the passage, to an abandoned intention of cele-
brating the ‘Albani patres,’ the royal line from which Rome was derived.
Again, we may credit the statement of hie biographer that his parentage
connected him with the country, where his early life was doubtleee
