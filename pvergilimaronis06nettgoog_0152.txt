ALEXIS.

A 0110111010 gives utteranca to 1110 1010 101 a beautiful youth, complaining 01 his in·
differenoe, urging him to come and live with him in the country, end finally up-
braiding himself for his infatuation.

Parts 01 this Eclogne are closely modelled after the eleveuth Idyl 01 Theocritus,
where the chlops addresses Galatea in a similar manner. We should be glad to
believe it to be purely imaginnry, though even then it is sufficiently degrading 10
Virgil. Suetonius, however, and Servius, have a story, also referred to by Martiel
(8. 56, dre.) and Apuleius (Apol. p. 2711011. Ε111100110101), that Alexis 10 intended 101
1110110οᾶ0011 youth belonging to Pollio (Martial says usercensem can hardly
have been then acquainted with the poet), and given by him to Virgil, who is
supposed by Spohn 10 have written the Eclogne as a mark 01 gratitudo to his patron.

Corydon and Alexis are probably follow-slaves though it 10 1101 easy to reconcile
tho various passages which seem 10 10101 10 Corydon's condition (vv. 2, 20-22, 57),
ond it is possible that Virgil may not have settled the point in his own mind,
Corydon being 111 fact a mixture 01 the ordinary Γ111100011101111 shepherd ond the
Gyclops.
¹ The heeohes (v. 3) and mountains (v. 5) again point to Sicily, not 10 Mantua, arrd
Sicily is expressly mentioned in v. 21.

This Eologne is generally supposed to have been the first writtcn; but, os
Keightley remarks, all that can bo asserted is, that it was earlier than the fifth, and
perhaps than the third (see 1101. 5. 86, 87).
