cviii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

horne out by the general coincidence between the notes bearing the
names of Philargyrins and Flagrus.

The compilor of these scholia was a Christian, and fond of alle-
goriaiug, a process to which Servius aud the older commentatore are
generally averse. Of his authorities T. Gallus and Gaudentius, and
their relations to the older commentatore, it is very difficult to affirm
anything with certainty. Comparing the notes attributed to Gallus with
those of Servius, 1 find that while cn G. l. 3 Servius and Gallus talre
opposite views, the two usually correspond, though not so closely as to
preclude the hypothesis that one is independent oi the other. For
instance, on G. 1. 13, Gallus adds a remark which is not in Servius,
and so on G. 1. 81. On G. 1. 8. 149, their notes arcto thesemo
purpose, though expressed independently: elsewhere they are nearly
identioal.

Did Servius theu horrow from Gallus, or Gallus from Servius? 'Phe
fact that on oue occasion their views are opposite, and that on others
they are independently expressed, seems to point rather to their having

both horrowed from the common storo of Virgilian commentary which

I have tried to show had been gathered hy the end of the fourth
century.

I am inclined to draw the same conclusion with regard to Servius
and Gaudentius. Hagen thinlrs that Servius horrowed from Gauden-
tius as from Gallus3 but although there are numerous instances where
the notes of Gaudentius and Servius coincide, there are some where
Servius is the fuller (a. 8. 21: G. 1. 277, 284: 4. 104, 11]), others
where, though Hagen sess traces of borrowing, Ι should he disposed to
say that the comments were independent (ll. 6. 79: (1.4. 122)st

Add to this the fact that Servius is never mentioned hy namo in the
Berne scholia, nor Gallus cr Gaudentius in the commentary of
Servius. .

Another indication which points to the conclusion that the authorities
of the Berne scholia are independent of Servius and Servius of them is
the lact that thoy several times preserve quotations from writers oi
authority ci which Servius has no trace. 'Phlason G. 3. 147, they in
common with Philargyrins quote Nigidius Figulus De animalibus,
while Servius has quite a different note. In other places they quote a
passage which, though absent in Servius and Philargyrins, serves to
fill up and complete the notes oi the latter. Thus on G. 3. 89 cur
