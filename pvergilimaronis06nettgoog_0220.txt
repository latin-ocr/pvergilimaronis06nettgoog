ECLOGA IX.

MOERIS.

LYOIDAS. MOERIS.

Tun historical occasion of this Eclogue hae been already adverted to in the Introduction
ιο u 1. After obtaining a promise cf protection, virgil, so says the traditional ac·
count, returned tc his property, when he found his enhance resisted aud iris life
menacedby an intruding soldier, whose name isvaricusly given as Arrius, Claudius,
or Millenus Toro. He soughtsafety in ssight, and made a second appealto tha highsr
authorities, which this time was crowned with more permanent success. Buaeus
conjectures that the present Eclogue was in fact a poetical petition presented ιο Varus
or Octavianus Certainly it is slrilfully contrived ιο interest the reader in the pcet's
favour. Moeris, cue of the servants, is going ιο ιιο town, Mantua doubiless, with
part of the fanu produce, which he is ιο girato the usurping proprietcr, when he is
stcpped by ο neighbour, Lycidas, relatss his and his master'e troubles, aud receives
ο warin expression of sympathy at a loss which had so nearly fallen cu the whole
district hythe death of their illustrious compatriot, some of the poet's verses being
quoted by way oi showing how grem that loss would have been, while virgis suc-
cessful return ie hiuted at as an event which will produce further poema There is
acompliment ιο Varus (r. 27), and another ιο Caesar (v. 46).

The frameworlr is more cr less borrowed from the Θαλύσιο of Theocritus (idyl 7),
the most personat of that poet’s wcrks, the first part of which is tairen up by an
οοοοοοι of a country welk, iu the course of which Lycidas, agcatherd. and a famous
singcr, cemes up with Simicbidas, the representative cf Theocritus, and consents to
sing with him as they journey along. Some passages in the Eclogue ara modelled
ou passages from other idyls which are referred ιο in the notes

Aa there ara nc hille or beecbes in the Mantuan territory, which, if any, must be
referred ιο rr. 7 foll, the scenery would seem ιο ιο imaginary or confused, ο οοοοΙο-
sion confirmed by r. 57. (See however note at the end of the Ecloguea)

Tlrs allegoriamg interpretation spohen of iu the Introduction ιο n. l has been
applied bere, though only in the case oi Amaryllis (v. 22), who has been supposed ιο
represent Rome. Moeris too, like Tityrus, has been thought ιο ιο the post’s father.

The correspondeucs between the specimeus quoted from Menalcas’ poetry, Lycidas
and Moeris first repeating three, then five lines each, is doubtless intentional„ Sec
the last paragraph cf the Introduction ιο ιιο Eelcgues.

The date of the poem is later thau that of Eclogue 5 (see v. 19), and consequently
than thoas of Eclogues 2 and 3. its relation to Eclogue 1 we can hardly determine
in the present etate of our knowledge, though Serv. pronouncee tirat Eclogue ιο ιο
the'earlier of tire two. [See Excursus at the end cf the Eulogue —H. N.]
