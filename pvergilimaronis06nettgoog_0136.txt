parallel, where pines and springs eall for the absent Tityrus, and where

mountain and vineyard about in the ears of Menalcas the apotheosis of
Daphnis. The former, properly understood, seems to be a piece of
graceful raillery, reminding the gardener that while he was away his
trees were undressed, and the bears, perhaps, wallowing in his springs.
The latter has a grandeur about it recalling the sublimity of Jewish
prophecy, at the same time that we are apparently intended to think
not only oi nature endowed with human feeling, but ot actual human
joy, the joy of the traveller on the mountain and of the vine-dresser
under the rock. Even the epithet intonsi orontes would seem to have
a double reference: iu one of its aspccts it suggests the notion of a
pathless wild, and thus brings out the universality of the rejoioing: in
another it makes ns feel with nature aa it were against man, representing
the mountains as glorying in that strength which nature gave and the
reign of Daphnis will secure to them, as the fir-trees and cedars in
lsaiah exult over theking of Babylon, “ Since thou art laid down, no
feller is come up against us.'’ So the same changes in the order of
nature are named at one time among the glories of the coming golden
age, at another aa effects of a general curse, which is to transfer the
rights of the strong and beautiful to the weak and contemptible. Under
the reign of Daphnis the wolf is to spara the sheep: in tbe youth of the
new-born ruler of the earth the oak is to distil houey: Pollio and his
admirer are to dwell in a dream-land where spicea grow on the bremble:
yet it is in images like these that Damon hurls his dying scorn at the
world where he has been robbed of his love. What can be more signifi·
eant than the apparently casual epithet arguta, applied in the very first
line of the seventh Eclogue to the tree under which Corydon and Thyrsis
are about to sing? Or let us take the passage which serves aa a com-
ment ou that epithet, the lines on Maenalus in Damon's song. Lucre·
tius,⁸ in his account of the origin of society and civilitation, tells us that
pastoral music must have been in the first instance an imitation of the
anund of the wind among the reads: bnt the thought gains indefinitely
when it is localized and transferred to Maenalus, “whose forests are ever
tnneful and his pines ever vocal, who is ever listening to the loves of
shepherds, and to Pan, the first who would not have the reeds left uni
employed.’' The personification of the mountain gives both definiteness
and majesty to the conception: the very fact that the connexion between

· vocal woods and shepherds’ songs is hinted rather than expressed isan

advantage even philosophically: aud the mention of Pan supplies that
mythological framework to which the theories of the ancients on the ἱ
history oi man primeva] owe so much, not only of beauty‚ but of sub
