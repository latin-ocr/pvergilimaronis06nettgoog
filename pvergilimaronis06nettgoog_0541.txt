DlDAOTIO POETS OF ROME. 421

haring been transcribed from an old MS. 1)] Sertorius Quadrimauns.
More ambitione than the former, to which however it is indebted for
several lines, it professes in its exordium ιο be the work of ovid, who
speaks of himself as led ιο his subject 1)] the soenes of his exile: but
though the lines in which the profession is made are not without
ability, those who should credit it would be compelled to suppose that
Orid's removal from Rome had made him forget the quantity of the

first syllable of “ dirigo,” as he ventures ιο address Glaucus—

“Quare si veteris durant vestigia moris,
si precibus hominum flectuntur numina ponti,

Huc adaia dirigasque pedes, umerosque natantis.’'

'I'he date of Serenus Sammonicus is at any rate earlier than that ol
Nemesianus, though it is questioned whether he is to be identified with
a personet that name, “ouius libri,'¹ says Spartianus, “plurimi ad
doctrinam exstant,’' who was put ιο death 1)] Caracalla, or with his
son, the preceptor of the younger Gordian, and the ralued friend of
Alexander Severus. His work, however, Dc Medicina Praecepta, in
1115 hexameters, is not properly a didactic poem at all, but merely a
medical treatise in metre. These who are fond of classical parallels

which, since prose composition existed, hare always been treated in
prose, are set ιο tune again by the perverse ingenuity oi grammaticus.

opening.

l‘ Membrorum series certo deducta tenore
Ut stet, nam similis medicinae defluit ordo, .
Principio celsa de corporis arce loquamur.
Phoebe, salutiferum, quod pangimus, adsere carmen,
Inventumque tuum prompto comitare lavore.
Tuque potens artis, reducem qui tradere vitam
Nosti, seu caelo manis revocare sepultos,
Qui oolis Aegeas, qui Pergama, quique Epidaurum,
Qui quondam placidi tectus sub pelle maeonis
Tarpeias arcis atque incluta templa petisti
Depellens taetros praesenti numine morbos,
Huc adea et quidquid cupide mihi saepe roganti
Firmasti, cunctum teneris expone papyria”

Now lot us listen to a remedy for a stiff neck.

“At si cervices durataque colla rigabunt,
Mira loquar, geminus mulcebitur unguine poples:
Hinc longum per iter nervos medicina sequetur:
Anseris ant pingui torpentia colla fovebis.
Inlinitur valido multum lene cocta in aceto,
