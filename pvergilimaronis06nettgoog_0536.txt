Of the Cyuepelleo of Gratius a much shorter notice will suffice. The
sole notice of the author or his work to be found among ancient writers
of antiquity is comprised in usingle pentameter ef Ovid (Ex Ponto, ι 16.
34), occurring at the end of a list of contemporary poets; a fact which
may help ue ιο reconcile the ahsolute silence of antiquity about Manilius
with the intrinsie probability that the Astrowemiee belong to a time not
much later than the Augustae age. All that we know cf the history of
the poet is confined to his name, which appears to have been a pet-name
given to slaves, thus suggesting the supposition that he was one of the
class of highly educated slaves, not uneommon in Roman familias, and
that the practical knowledge of his subject which his poem displays had
heen gained in the course of his ordinary duties. The cognomen “ Falis-
cus,” which is sometimes added to his name, rests on the authority oi a
MS. which perhaps never existed,⁶ and of a line in the poem itself.⁶
The extant evidence for the text oi the Oyueyetiea is a single ΜΒῚἵ
, which ie evidently imperfect, though perhaps not to any grem degree,
and in parts as evidently corrupt. A corrupt or imperfect text, how·
ever, will not account for the harshnessee and obscurities with whieh the
poem is disfigured. These must in the main be imputed ιο the writer,
who, having none hut common thoughts to express, isneverthelees not ἰ
content ιο express them in common language.

The poem consiste of a single book of elo lines. Its opening is not
nnpromising. The subject is proposed medestly enough, “the gift oi
heaven, the arte that bring the huntsman suceess,'' end Dianeis invoked
as the natural patroness of the subject, the goddess who, with the other
silvan powers, came tothe help of primeval man in his nnequal struggle
with the brutas, and taught him ιο remedy by art the defecta of his
natural condition. The poet then proceeds at once to describe the con·
sanction of a net, and to speak cf the best localities for getting the
materiale. Then follows a digression which reads like a piece of the

⁴ In taking leave of Manilius, I will venture to suggest an emendation of his text.
The passage is in Book 1, v. 245, “Nos iu nocte sumus, somnosque in membra
