P. VERGILI MARONIS

GEORGICON

LIBER SECUNDUS.

'l'nr main enbjeot oi the Seoond Book is the oulture of trees, especially of the vine.
But there is no great regularity in the mode ol treatment Virgil opens with an
enumeration oi the different ways of propagating troes, natural and artifloial, so asto
give some notion of the magnitude of the theme: then shows how antean improve
upon nature, and reours again tothe maniloldness of his subject, dwelling especially
on the innumerable varieties oi vines. Without mnoh relevaney he talks oi the trees
whioh are indigenous todifferent oountries, and is thenoe drawn off into an eulogyoi
Italy, whioh he does not fit with any praetiosi application. The question oi the
aptitudes ol various soils is treated iar more widely than the snbjeot ol the book re·
quires, embreoing the ohoioeoi oorn and pastore land as well as ol ground lor planting
vines and other trees. For the next 160 lines the poet seems to be thinking exolu-
sively of the vine or ol the trees planted in the‘arbnstum' as its supportem He does ’
not distinguish between the different modes ol rearing therme, but in general appears
to assume thet the ‘arbustum ⁹ will be the means adopted. He speaks of tho vine and
ite supportem almost indifferently‚ es objeots more or less of the sameoulture, so that
while keeping the former prominently before him he ieels himself et liberty to use
general lenguage, or even to oonflne his language to the latter, as metrioal eonvenienoe
or poetioal variety may suggest: a manner ot' speaking whioh rendere this part ol the
book peonliarly diffioult, et least to an nnprofeseional oommentator. The olive, which
wes put forward prominently in the programma of the boolr, is actually disposed ol
in a very lew lines, as requiring hardly any culture at all, while the other fruit-trees
are dismissed even more briefly. The remaining trees reoeire a very hasty reeom-
mendation to the oultivator‚ beoked however with an essuranoe that they are even
more usefnl to man than the vine. In the eelebrated digression which oonelndes the
book tho laborious espect of a oountry lile, elsewhere so prominent, is studiously
kept out ol sight, and we heer only oi ease, enjoyment, and plenty. Its interest as
bearing on the testes oi the poet himself has been notioed in the genem introduction
to the Georgios.

The beauties of this book hare always been edmired, and deserwedly so. Theyare
most oonspiouous in the digressions; bnt the more striotly didsotio part oontains
innumereble felioities ol expression, though it may be doubted whether in general
they do not obsonre the praetiosi meaning as mueh ae they illustrate it-whether in
leot they do not constitute the strongest oondemnetion oi that sohool ol poetry ol
whioh they are so illustrioris an example

As in the ease ol Book 1, we oen say nothing oi the date. All that we knowis
