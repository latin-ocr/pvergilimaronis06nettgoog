THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxiii

may infer almost with certainty that had the Verona scholia or any
other commentary of equal fulness come down to us unimpaired, we
should have found that Servius was indebtsd to Asper to a far greater
extent thau we should otherwise bare been led to suspect. Many of
the numerous quotatious from Terence aud Sallust scattered through
the notes ol Servius are, I can hardly doubt, taken from Asper, who, as
we shall see iu a moment, was fond 01 illustratiug his notes from Sallust.

The remarks ol Asper, whether they refer to matters of textual
criticism or of interpretation, are ior the most part scholarlilre aud
interesting even when they fail to carry conviction. Iu Aen. 10. 539,
be preferred to read insignibus ermis to imiguitue albia, basiug his
pretereuce ou a quotation from Sallust. But there cau hardly be a
doubt that Probus was right bere iu reading alon. Iu Aen. 10. 673
he was clearly right in reading gnorare, not quosve, aud iu line 737 of
the same book as clearly wrong iu reading viris ior oiri. lull. sol Ι
should be inclined to iuter from the note in Servius that Asper was led
from au apparent parallel iu Sallust toread aurae, the old genitive
singular, for curce. In (1123010 (as we leem from the Berue
scholia) rightly defended in volnere as against in 00111010.

Ol Asper's sense aud iusight as an interpreter all remaining indi-
cations would lead us to think highly. In Aen. 9. 418, for instance,
he pointed ont that per tempus utrumque mustbe taken as = inter tempus
0111111101ιο; in Georg. 2. 324 (vere tament terroe) his good sense told him
that terrac was nom. pl, not (as Donatus took it three centurias after·
warde) the gen. sing.; iu Aen. 9. 886 he took impr-adens as=i9uoram
ae metisse. Other explanatious of his appear more ingenious thau
souud: as, for instauoe‚ when iu 10. 188 he took cumen vestrum to
mean ceusu vestrae nmtctionis: or when iu Aen. 2. 305 hs explained
montano streniae as=ma9uo flumine.- or in Aen. 4. 146 picti Agathyrsi
as stigmoai, tattooed, an opiniou‘from which Servius dissents: or iu 9.
678 amoti ferro as=serreo cordo hahmtea Some oi bis notes on points
of interpretation appear to have come from Verrius Flaccus. Thus he
says on Aen. 10. 6 (see Scholia Veronensia) that quianam is au archaia
word. Servius, whose note does not name Asper but is probably
iudebted to him, quotes quianam from Ennius. Now this was also
the case with Verrius Flaccus’ note ou the word (Festus, p. 257),
though the instances quoted by Festus and Servius are not identical.
So also perhaps with the note on unum luctis in the Verona scholia ou
Eol. 7. 33 “Asper. Sinum est vas vinarium, ut Cicero siguificat, non,
