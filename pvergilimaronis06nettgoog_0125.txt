INTRODUOTION. 5

spite cf ourselves, to interrogate that nature which underlies the many
varieties of art. Yet πθ may realize something of the feeling if πθ go
back to the time when the office of a translator ranked as high in Eug-
lish estimatiou as that of au original poet-when he that drew Zimri
aud Achitophel was thought to have added to his farne hy his versione ot
Juvenal aud Virgil, aud the preparation of the English Iliad and Odys·
sey occupied, perhaps uot unworthily, teu of the best years of the mind
which had produced the Essay ou Critieism and the Rape of the Lock.

But whatever may be its susceptibility of explanation or illustratiou
, the fact is one which requires to be borne iu mind hy every student of
the Eclogues. Without the spirit of allowance which πθ are ready to
entertaiu as sucu as we perceive that a peculiarity is not individnal or
occasioned, but general, πθ should hardly be able to moderate our snr-
prise at the numberless instances of close aud indeed servile imitation
which an attentive perusal shows ns at once. It is one thing to accept

broadly the statement that Virgil is a copyist, aud quite another to ·

follow him line by line aud observa how eonstautly he is thinking of

his guida, lookiug to him where a simple reliauoe ou nature would have Ἰ
baeu uot only far better, hut far more easy aud obvious, aud ou many
occasions deviatiug from the passage immediately before him only to
cast a glauce ou some other part of his model¹ Tityrus, Galatea,
Amaryllis, Corydon, Thestylis, Menalcas, Damoetas, Amyntas, Aegon,
Daphnis, Thyrsis, Micon, Lycidas, are all names to be found iu the
muster-roll of Theocritns3 aud of those uot included thereiu there is
not oue (if πθ except, what are really no exceptione, actual historical
personages) which is not referable to a Greek, perhaps a bucolic
original. Corydon addresses Alexis in the lauguage used by Poly·
phemus to Galatea: boasts iu the same way of his thousand sheep aud
his never-failiug supply of milk: answers objections to his personal
appearance iu the same way by au appeal to the ocean mirror: paints
in similar colonrs the pleasnres of a rural life: glauces similarly at
the pets he is rearing for his love: and finally taxes himself for his
fully, aud reminds himself that there are other loves to be found iu
the world, in laugnage which is as nearly as may he a translation from
the eleveuth Idyl. Menalcas and Damoetas rally each other in words
horrowed from two neighbouriug Idyls: two others supply the
lauguage iu which they make their wagers: while a large proportiou
of the materials for their amoebeau display is tc be found iu the same
or other parts of Theocritus, seattered up eud down. Iu the friendly
rivalry of Menalcas and Mopsus the depreciation of Amyntas, the
grief of the wild heasts for Daphnis, the epitaph, the apotheosis in
