INTRODUOTION. 7

ference. It is the commonplace of the art, used by a young artiat:
the writing at the bottom of the picture for tear the picture should
not be recognized3 the tunes of the master imitated by the pupil he-
cause he thinks that thereis no other way of speaking correctly.
Theocritus might talk generally cf the Muses and of bucolic song: to
Virgil the Muses must be the Muses oi Sicily, and the song the song

of Maenalus. Even Bi0n⁸ and Moschus, coming after Theocritus, had
to appeal to Sicilian associatione: how much more one notin possession
of the links of sympathy imparted by a common country aud common
laugnaga and au almost hereditary transmission of the poetical gift?
And what is true oi Virgil's relation to Theocritus is true to a certain
extent of his relation to Greek writers generally and to the whole
body of learning which he possessed. He had donbtless lived from Α
boyhood in their world: and their world accordingly became a sort of
second naturate him-a storehouse oi life and trnth and beauty, the ·
standard to which he brought conceptione and images as they rose up .
within him, the suggestive gnido that was to awaken bis slumberiug
powers, and lead him to discover further felicities yet possible to the
artist. This habit of mind perhaps strikes us most in cases whereit is
most slightly and, it would almost seem, uuconsciously indicated. More
than one writer has remarked on Virgil’s practice of characteriaing
things by some local epithet, as a peculiarity by which he is distin·
guished from the earlier Latin poeta. Doubtless in many instances
there is some special reason for the choico of the word: it may point
to some essential attribute of the thing, or some accidental connexion
with time aud place which has a real significance in the context. But

there are others where it is not easy to perceive auy such relevancy.
What appropriateness can there be in describing the hedge which

’ bloasoms feu upon by ae bees of Hyan, or ln aa wisa anat the
swarma which Moeris has to look after may avoid the yews of Corsica‘?
The epithet here is significant not to the render bnt to the poet,
orto the render ouly so far as he happens to share in the poet’s
intellectnal antecedents: it appeals not to a first-hand appreciation
of the characteristica of natural objects, such as is open to all, but

to information gained from reading or traval, and therefore confined
to a few. And from what we know of the facts of Virgil's
