highest classes in the larger schools‚ and those who read for
classieal honours at the Universities. As a general rule, how·
ever, Ι have said nothing where Ι 111 161 think it possible that
6 doubt might arise in the mind of a fairly instrueted reader.
My custom has been 16 16116 every line as it 66116 before me, and
aslr myself whether Ι thoroughly understood it; and this process
1166 61161 161 me to entertain difficulties which had not previously
made themselves 1611. Some of these Ι have 66116 16 think oi
importunae: others 6 little consideration 1166 suffieed 16 diapel:
hut it seemed worth while to endeavour 16 preclude the latter no
less than the former. Ι have not in general desired to furnish
information 616 kind which is to-be found in Lexicons, or in the
well-known Dictionaries of Antiquitiee, Biography and Mythology,
and Geography. With regard to the last-named works, however,
my practice 1166 161 been very consistent: I have frequently re·
ferred the reader to them, and 66 frequently left him to 16161
himself. Ι 11161, however, that this awkwardness has not been
productiva of any serious inconvenience.

ἢ The essays which Ι have ventured to introduce in different parts
of the volume are intended in 616 way or another to illustrate the
literary peculiaritiea 61 Virgil‘s poema. Possibly they may be

. found interesting 61 their own account, 66, with the signal excep-

tion of (1616161 Mure's unlinished work, to which I may now add
Professor Sellar‘s book on the Roman Poets of 1116 Republic, our
language is singularly deficient in slretches 61 the history of
classical literature.a Here, as elsewhere, l have written rather for
16611616 than for scholare: I have sought to populariae what
already 611616 in less accessible forms. Two 61 these essays, those
introductory 16 the Eelogues 611 the Georgica, wera substantially
delivered as public lecturas before the University: the remaining
two, which are 61 much slighter texture, were written for the
present publication.

With regard to the text, I may refer generally to what Ι have
661111 the Preface to my second volume‘ The publication of
Ribbech’s apparatus criticus has made a new recension necessary,

, though here as well 66111116 Aeneid I have accepted his facts
