THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ vntum lxi

IULIUS MODESTUS.

Ribbeck conjectures that this scholar, the freedman of Hyginus
(Suetonius De illustribus Grammaticis 20), who commentcd on Horace,
made also some scattered remarks upon Virgil. Iam not aware, hovv·
ever, that any Virgilian notes are iu existence which can with certainty
be referred to him. The name of Aufidius Modestus occurs (if the
reading he certain) in a note by Philargyrius on the words coniurato
Histro (Georg. 2. 497); bnt cau we he certain that the same person is
intended? Ribbeck thinks that the long note in Nonius, p. 377, on
moue and pretioue comes from the quaestiones confusae of Iulius
Modestus. And undoubtedly Philargyrius on Georg. 3. 53 (cruram
unce) remarks, Modestus terrac pro fiee accipit, aud Nouius
says ipsum mua . . . maxime tinem terminumque designat. It is,
however, at least as probable that both Modestus and Nonius owed
their information to Verrius Flaccus, for in Festus, p. 367, wc read
tenos significat finem, ut cum dicimus Meteone. And more oi this
note on tanroeI suspect is to be found in the note of Servius on Aen.
6. 62, hactenus, hucusque: id est hic sit finis, Nam tenua est proprie
extrema pars-arcus, ut Plautus ostendit (Bacch. 4. 6. 23) “ita intendi
tenus‚'’ unde tractum est ut hacteuus hucusque significet.

However the case may really have stood, we have here again, as in
the instance ci the note on bidens, a valnable specimen of the scholar·
ship of the Augustam age.

L. ANNAEUS CORNUTUS.

Cornutus, the contemporary and friend ot Silius Italicus, and the
revered tutor of Persius, was hanished by Nero an. 68. He was the

Ι author of commentarii Arcados, which are mentioned by Charisius, pp.

100 and 102, and apparently of remarks ou the Eclogues. A few of

his notes are quoted in the Verona scholia aud in the commentary
of Servius. In Aen. 1. 45, he would have preferred “inflixit’' to
“ infixit '' as more forcible (vehementius): in Aen. 1. 150, he defended
voleat against volant, and iu Aen. 9. 348, he read for “multa morte
recepit'’ “multa nocte recepit.‘' These specimens do not impress us
very deeply with a sense of his critical power3 nor does he always

appear to much advantage as an interpreter. In Aen. 9. 675, for
instance, he took “ commissa ’⁹ as equivalent to “clausa ”3 an inter-
pretation improbable in itself, and which is wholly ignored in the note
on this passage in Nonius p. 249. A few other notes ot Cornutus,

, hardly worth quoting here, may be found iu Servius and the Verona

scholia.
