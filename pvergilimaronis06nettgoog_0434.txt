314 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Currentem ilignis potare canalibus undum3
Aestibus at mediis umbrosam exquirere vallem,
Sicubi magna Iovis antiquo robore quercus
Ingentis tendat ramos, aut sicubi nigrum
Ilicibus crebris sacra nemus accubet umbra3
Tum tenuis dare rursus aquas, et pascere rursus
Solis ad occasum, cum frigidus adra vesper
Temperat, et saltus reficit iam roscida luna,
Litoraque alcyonem resonant, acalanthida dumi.
Quid tibi pastores Libyae, quid pascua versu
