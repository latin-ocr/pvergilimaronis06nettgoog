THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxv

soon began to languish at Rome. But these writers maintained their
reputatiou out ot Italy, and the curiosity of Probus was awakeued by
reading some of them with a provincial lecturer. 'Phe study of these
authors inspired him to go on to others, and regardless of the fact that
the pains he was spending was likely to gain him nothing but dis·
credit, he determined to devote bis life to the emendation, punctuation,
aud explanation oi ancient texts. Among these he appears to have
paid special attention to Terence, Lucretius, and Virgil. Probus pob-
lished little of importance in his liietime, but leit a considerable post-
humous work in the shape of a “Silva observationum sermonis
antiqui,” from which a meat deal, I suspect, has filtered into the work
oi the later grammarians.

Probus was alive, as we may infer from Martial’saddress to his third
book (3. 2. 12, “illo vindice nec Probum timeto’')‚ in 88 aa: but
his merita had been recognized at Rome some thirty years bcfore.⁶
He did not open a school, or form pupils in the ordinary sense ol the
word. But he had admirere with whom, like Socrates in a higher
path oi speculation, he would converse, and perhaps did more in this
way than he would have done by direct tecchiug to stimulate the love
oi antiquity which marks the scholare oi the generalior which followed
him. His influence is very marked iu the Noctes Atticae of Gellius,
who hed known aud conversod with friends of Probus.

J udging from the remains of his notes which have been preserved in
Servius and other later writers, one would be inclined to assign to him
without question the first place among the commentatore on Virgil.
His remarks on the text ol the poet are of the utmost velue, whether
we regcrd them es based ou his own conjectures, or (as Ι am more
inclined to suppose) on the inspectior of excellent manuscripts now
lost. That Probus did not spere himself the labour ‚or consulting the
oldest accessible documenta we know from Gellius 13. 21. 4, where he
is said to have examined a manuscriptos the first Georgia corrected
by the hand of Virgil himself, with the view of settling the question
whether the aco. pl. of urbe should be spelt urbia or ortes. He had

probably also looked at good copies oi the Aeneid before he appealed
to Aen. 2. 224, 460 and 3.106 on the matter. His common sense is

aa notable aa his industry. The question, he maintained, would bave
been decided by Virgil not in pedentic accordance with a fixed rule,

but according to the jodgmeut of his ear.

In Aen. 7. 773 the undoubtedly true reading Phoebigenam, which is
found iu none oi our manuscripts, is ducto Probus. It is difficolt to

believe that he hit upon this by conjecture, or (to put the same statement

‘Jerome to en. 56, “Probus Berytius eruditissimus grammaticorum Romae
“billi’' θ
