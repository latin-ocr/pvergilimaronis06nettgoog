Tuta is another maging-match between Corydon aud Thyrsis, with Daphnis as um·
pire. Unlilre those in Eologues 3 and 5, ιι ends deciairely in the defeat of Thyrsis.
The story ιο told by Meliboeus, who was not present until the terme ol the contest
had been agreed ou, so that of them we hear nothing.

Theldyls of Theocr. which Virgil seems chiefly ιο bave bad in view are the oth
and eth.

Various attempta were made by the earlier critias to identify the characters, Cory·
don being supposed ιο be Virgil or a friend of Virgil's, Thyrsis a contemporary naal,
or even, according ιο Corda, Virgil‘s great prototype Theocritus, Meliboeus and
Daphnis patrous of the poet, if not the poet himself. Serv, who mentions this
rnode of interpretation without adopting ιι, makes Codrus (v. 22) au historioal per-
sonage, asserting on the authority of the Elegics of Valgius (Dict B.) that be was a
contemporary poet; but tho clauso is apparently omitted in some of the MSS. of the

old commentator. [See also the Verona Scholia quoted ou y. 22] Nothing in the
poam points to any historica} basis; all ean be explained by supposing it to be an
imaginary Eclogne iu the Theocriteau style. There does not evan seem to be any
necessity for suppoeing that in introducing Meliboeus, Daphnis, and Corydon, Virgil
is thinking uniformly of the Meliboeus, Daphnis, aud Corydon cf former Ecloguee,
though there is some appropriateness in making Daphnis the bestower οι the crown
of poetry‚ aad Corydon, the hero of Ecl. 2, its receirar.

The socnery is, as maai, confused. Arcadian shepherds are made ιο sing in the
neighbourhood of the Mincius, while neither the ilex (w. l), the plne (v. 24), the
chestnut·(v. 53), nor the tlocks af goats (v. 7), would seem ιο belong to Mantua
