Epicurean, though this tradition ltsell may be merely 00 awkward attempt to give an
historical basis to silenus song. Like the eighth Eclogue, it appears to be a sort of

that Virgil wished to write on Roman history, but was deterred by the subject. This
aspiration may be said to have been afterwards lulfllled iu the Aeaeid: but the
