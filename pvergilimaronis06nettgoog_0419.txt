GEORGICON LIB. Ill. 299

Sin ad bella magis studium turmasque ferenes,
Aut Alphea rotis praelabi flumina Pisae, rao
Et Iovis in luae eurrus agitare volantis,
Primus equi labor est, animes atque arma videre
Bellantum, lituosque pati, tractuque gementem
Ferre rotam, et stabulo frenos audire sonantis;
Tum magis atque magis blandis gaudere magistri 185
Laudibus et plausae sonitum cervinis amare.
Atque haee iam primo depulsus ab ubere matris
Audeat, inque vieem det mollibus ora capistris
Invalidus etiamque tremens, etiam inscius aevi.
