THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxxi

Charisius, and Prisciani these are alcas, chorte, claues, eicie, ecla,
mina, pree, palumbes, penus, papaver, senas, sal, scopate, and stirps.

Retnrning, then, to Nonius, we lind that his alphabetical arrange·
ment, his grammatical treatment, and the considerable number oi
instances common to both writers, suggesta close relation between his
third hook aud the sources of Priscian l, pp. 169-71‚andarelati0n0f
some kind, though not nearly so close, between this book and the
sources oi Charisius, pp. 70-109.

We know that Probus aud Caper treated separately oi the question
of doubtful gender (de datiis peceribus). I think it, then, extremely
probable that Nonius' third hook is neither more nor less thau an
extract from the work oi oue or the other of these writers.⁸ Charisius,
on the other hand, in the section which we have been consideriug, was,
I believe, drawing either direetly or indirectly upon Pliny's books
¹ dubii samoris. This I think probable, not merely from the express
mention of Pliuy’s name, but also from the range of the quotations.
And the coincidences between Charisius and Nonius Iwould explain
by supposing that Probus either drew upon Pliny's trectise, which hc
may well have dona, as he outlived Pliny by some years, or that he
used the same authorities. (Comp. Prisc. 1, p. 393, Plinium etProbam.)

Before quitting this part of my subject, I would observo that there
are various points of contest between the third book oi Nonius aud
Verrius Flaccus. It is remarkable, also, that Verrius is often cited by
Charisius in the sectiou so often alluded to. The natural inference is
that Probus and Pliny both drew largely upon the lexicon aud the
grammatica] treatisee oi Verrius.

BOOK VH.

Du Consulens Canusinus Vuaeonun.

This book mostly consists of notes upon verbe, which in old Latin
were used both as activas and as deponente, or (in other words) verbs
whose deponent form was also used as a passive.

There are also remarks on other rare or antiquated verbsl forms, as
reddito for reddam, fite the imperative of fio, and the like. There isa
remarkable coincidence between the lists of deponent verbs illustrated

’ by Nonius, and parts of the eighth book of Priscian. We are con·

fronted here by a phenomenon similar tc that noticed in the last

section with regard to Charisius. Priscian has two sections sncceediug

volume ol his Grammatici Latini.
