nius and Nemesianus), stated reasons for restoring the whole to Cal·
purnins. The tide now turned: Burmann, in the praiaco to his

⁰ ‘Poetae latini Minores’ (Leydeu, 1731), accepted Ulitius’ view, though,

like him, he did not venture in his text to disturb the received divisi0n;
and Wernsdorf, fifty years afterwards, in his praiaco cited above, and
in an introductory essay on Calpurnius and his Eclognes, enforced the
same doctrine by an array of arguments which till very lately were
generally supposed tc have set the question at rest. The main eon·
siderations on which he relies are the absence ot any mention of N eme·
sianus as a pastoral writer by Vopiscus, who allodes to his other works,
as well as hythe earlier scholare atter the revival of learning, the fact
that no MS. containing his undisputed works contains these pastorals,
the insufficiency ot a single MS. authority, the seli-contradictory cha·
rector of the testimony supplied by the Parma edition, which apparently·
shows that in that single MS. the arrangement had been tampered
with by a later hand, the similarity oi the style of the two sets oi
poems, ‘ut lac lacti simillimus' aud the probability that Calpurnius
would write neither more nor less than eleven pastorals, that being the
number of the Idyls ot Theocritus which may fairly be called rustic
proper-an argument somewhat recondite in itselt, and depending on
a proposition which has itselt to be supported by a good deal of wire·
drawn reasoniug‚ of too special a character to be detailed here. So
matters appearto have, stood till the publication of Maurice Haupt’s
‘De Carminibus Bucolicis Calpurnii et Nemesiani Liber' (Leipsie,
1854). In this monograph, which in its comprehensive knowledge and
ingenuity of conjecture is a fair specimen of the best German scholar-
ship of our day, the divided authorship of these Eulogues is strongly
asserted Rejecting consideratione grounded on the literary character
ot the several poems as too dependent on individual toste to furnish
material for argument, the writer points out one remarkable peculiarity
which discriminatae the undisputed Calpurnian Eclogues from the others,
the absence oi elisione iu any toot but the first, most oi the few apparent
exceptione being shown either to arise from false readings, or to be
such as really prove the rulo—a degree of strictness transcending that
oi Tibullus, Lygdamus, and Ovid, who are particular only not to elide
long vowels after the first ioot, whereas Calpurnius does not elide long
vowels at all. From this positive proof ot a distinction of authors, a
prcof all the stronger as being furnished as it were, unoonsciously by
the poems themselves, ha proceeds to controvert Wernsdorf’s argu-

ments for identity. The argument drawn from the supposed number
oi the rustic Idyls of Theocritus he meets not only by denying the
proposition on which it restabat by showing how easily a conuter
argument might be oenshncted to prove that Calpurnius wrote only
