ovi THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

almost deservo the namo of classieal, for it is clear that in the main it
is constructed ont of very ancient matorials. For his information on
· points of history and antiqnities Servius drawa, very likely at second
or third hand, on (lato, Varro, Nigidius, and other authors oi the same
stamp: for mythology on Hyginus, for grammar and philology on
Varro and Verrius Flaccus. The views 01 these writers 116 probably
learned from tho scholare of 1111 ond oi the first and beginning oi tho
second centurias, as Asper and Probus, and the writers of the time oi
Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antoninos. He quotes, indeed, writers of
1111 third and fourth centuries, as Sammonicus Serenus, J uba, Solinus,
Terentianus Maurus, Statius Tullianus, Titianus, and Catulinns3 hut
since the age of tho Antoninos, if we may judge by 1116 original
remarks of so celebrated a scholar as Aelius Donatus (see on p. 0.),
little ii anything that was both new and true had boen added 10
Iatin scholarship.

Of Titianus and Catulinus a word or two must bo said before we
leave this part of our subject. On Aen. 10. 18 Servius mentions these
⁴ writers as the authors oi a troatise which might in modern phraseology
be entitled ‘⁴ Virgil as a Rhetoriciau”: “Titianus ot Catulinus, qui
themata omnia de Vergilio elicuerunt ad dicendi usum.'' A fact most
important as illustrating the declino both of scholarship and education.
The curriculum of education is bocoming moro and more limited to
the study oi Virgil; the study 01 Virgil is becoming more and more
scholastio and technical. Are thoro any actual remains of these base
and degenerate efforts of analysis? Tho fourth book oi Macrobius
is au excellent specimen oi what this method could effect. Amore
fragment of 1116 book romains, in which a thousand and one instanoos
aro given 01 Virgil's command over the resources of pathos. I 11116
noticed a great many similar remarks in 1111 commentary oi Servius, of
which the following may ho taken as specimens:

A. 4. 31, et suasoria ost omni parte plena: nam 11 purgat obiecta 61
ostendit utilitatem 61 a timore persuadet Et usus est apto causae ,
principio, nam et cum aliquid proptor nos petimus, benevolum nobis
enm qui audit facero dehemus, dc.

A„ 4. 361, oratorie ibi finivit nbi 111 argumenti constit't.

A. 6. mummolenum adlocutionom hane esse suasoriam cum
partibus suis.

A. 7. 535, rhetorico viles trudit in medinm3 nobiles 1610 primo et
ultimo commemorat loeo.

A. 8. 127, et est rhetorica persuasio, nam principium ex utriusque
persona sumpsit.

A. 8. 374, sane hoo rhetorica suasio est, nam principatum averecundia
sumpsit.
