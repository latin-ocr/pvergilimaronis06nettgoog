BUCOLIO POETS OF ROME. 127

cn the bark of a neighbcnring cherry· tres sir, earth, and water are
invoked to cen-y the lameut to the ears of Meliboeus, whom the poet
theu proceeds to panegyrice.

‘⁴ Longa tibi cunctisque diu spectata senectus,
Felicesqne anni, nostrique novissimus aeri
Circulus, innocuae clauserunt tempore vitae.
Nec miuus hinc nobis gemitus lacrimaeque there,
Quam si florentis mors invida pelleret annos.
Nec tenuit telis communis causa querellas:
Heu, Meliboee, iaces letali frigore segnis
Lege hominum, caelo dignus, canente senecta,
concilioque Deum. Plenum tibi ponderis aequi
Pectus erat: tu ruricolam discernere lites
Admone, varias patiens mulcendo querellas.
Sub te ruris amor, sub te reverentia iusti
Flcrnit, ambiguos signavit terminus agros.
Blanda tibi vultus gravitas, et mite serene
Fronte supercilium, sed pectus mitius crs.”

The usual topice-then succeed: the gode of the country bring gifts
in honour cf the dead: trees and herds, ‘nostra armenta,’ repeat his
name: for the sea andland will change their inhabitants, and the pro-
ducts of the seescns become confused, before Timeles will cesse to sing
cf him. Tityrus complimente the singen, hints that the song may he

species of promotion which these shcpherds appear especially to desire,
and finally reminds him that the honr is late. Epe'pbccce (ivri-funus)
is the title which the MSS. give to the poem—a curicusly illiterato
confusion cf Greek and Latin.

The second Eclcgue is entitled Docuce, the name cf a girl who hus
been removed by her parents from the passionate pursuit of two shepherd
boys, Alcon and Idas, and whose absence they accordingly lament in
amoeheau straiue Itis modelled to a certain extent on Calpurnius'
second and third Eclcgues, not without some exaggeratius and coarseness
of hendling, which are due to the author himself. The images in which
the lovers express their longing are, as usual, borrowed from Theocritus
orVirgil: onerecommends himself on account of his wealththe other ou
the sccre of his personal appearance: one talks cf cll nature as blighted
to him while Douace is awey, the other reminds her that gods have led
achepherd's life: and evening as usual comes in to stop the singing.
The only noticeable passage is about a tame nightingale, which Alcon
has sent as a present tc Donace, though the thought gains bnt little
from its expression.

‘⁴ Munera namque dedi, noster qnae nou dedit Idas,
Vocslem, longos quae ducit, sedens, cantus:
