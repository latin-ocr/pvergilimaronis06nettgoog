ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LA'PER DIDrlCTIO Poa'rs OF ROllli. 411

Ramsey, to whose article iu the Dictiouary oi Biogrephy those who are
desimus of further informatiou may be profitably referred, reconciles
these apparently conflicting facte by supposiug that the poem, bearing,
as it does, marks of incompletenass, may never have been published,
bnt that a copy or two may have got into private circulation, aud so
may have been accidentally preserved. I do not pretend to have given
the work such au examination as would qualify me to form au inde·
pendent opiniou; nor would Iveutura to decide whether, as some have
supposed, his lauguage would not lead us to believe him to have been
a foreiguer. The work is apparently written with that average com-
mend of the hexameter which, after the example set by Virgil, beram

almost a matter oi coume ior a Roman poet, aud the language has
much of that elaboratiou and point which after the Augustan age was
exacted as a necessity, while it almost ceased to he a merit: but there
is uo genuine energy or felicity oi diction: the expressions are fre·
quently forced, and the thoughts, whcre not obvious, are apt to
degenerata into conoeits. Ipropose to justiiy this characteres a poem
which numbers the younger Scaliger and Bentley among its editors,
and Creech, not the worst versifier of Dryden’s contemporaries, among
its translators, by a lew extracts from the more professedly poetical
passages, and afterwards to give some notiou oi the general mode of
treatment by au analysis oi the First Book.

Each of the five books is introduced by a long exordium, iu which

the author was evidently anxious to display his powers as a poet. The
first book has an introduction of 117 lines, the second oi at least 59,

the third of 42, the fourth oi 121, the fifth of 29: and similar halting-
places are furnished hythe conclusione of the first and third books·
In the opening oi the second book Manilius elaboratas the same
thought which is enforced by Virgil et the beginning oi the Third
Georgia, the difficulty oi finding a subject which had not been
exhausted by previous treatment: hut it is easy to see how iar the
rhetorician is removed from the poet. After speaking of Homer iu
lines oi which the text is too uncertain to make them worth quoting,
he comes to Hesiod,

“Proximus illi
Hesiodus memorat divos divomque parentis
Et Chaos enixum terras, orbemque sub illo
inierim, et primos titubantia sidera partus,
Titanasque senes, Iovis et cunabula magni,
Et sub trahe viri nomeu, aine hatra parentis,
Atque iterum patrio nascentem corpore Bacchum,
Omniaque immenso volitantia lumina mundo.
Quinetiam ruris aulius legesque notavit
Militiamqus soli, quod eolles Bacchus amaret,
Quod facunda Oetes campos, quod Pallas utrumque,
