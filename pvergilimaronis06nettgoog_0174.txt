14 P. VERGILI MARONIS

Permixtos heroas et ipse videbitur illis, Ι
Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem.
1111 tibi prima, puer, 11110 munuscula cultu
Errantis hederas passim cum baccare tellus
Mixtaque ridenti colocasia fundet acantho. 20
ipsae lacte domum referent distenta capellae
Ubera, neo magnos metuent armenta leones.
Ipsa tibi blandos fundent cunabula flores.
