of Macrobius. Macrobius, who held high offices of state in 399, 410,
and 422 nn, probably wrote his Saturnalia at the end of the fourth or
beginning of the fifth century. The dialogus, however, isin Platonic
and Ciceronian fashion‚ thrown some twenty years back, being supposed
to take place before the death of Praetextatus (385 aa.) Servius is
spoken of as at that time a man who had only recently adopted the
profession of teaching‚ bnt who had already acquir-ed a high reputation
both for learning and modesty (Sat. 1. 2. 15). He is described further
(ib. 6. 6. l), as occupied every day in explaining Virgil to the Roman
youth, and the duty of answering hostile criticisms upon thil is, to
a large extent, assigned to him.

Iam glad to find that M. Thomas has come to the same conclusion
as that for whichI have already contended‚ that the Servius of the
Saturnalia stands in no real relation to the Servius of our commentary,
except in so far as the notes on Virgil in Macrobius can be shown to
be ultimately derived from the same sources as those in the commentary
of Servius. The idea that Macrobius is quoting from the actual com-
mentary of Servius cannot, Ι think, any longer be defended. All in·
ternal evidence points, as Ihave attempted to show, in anotherdirection.
Macrobius was himself, in all probability, using old commentaries and
treatises now lost, which were the source of manya note in Philargyrius
and Servius; and it was only natural, from a literary point of view,
that he should pay Servius the compliment of assiguing to him the
duty of expounding this Virgilian learning.

Whether the commentary of Servius which we now possess was
published at the time when the Saturnalia vvere written is a point

which Ι do not think there is evidence to decide. If we take the
langnage held in tha Saturnalia as seriously affecting the question, we
mast conclude that in the year 380, or thereaboats, Servius was known
not as a writer but only as a very learned teacher‚ and that his com·
mentary was not published until after the publication of the Saturnalia.
But the character of that dialogus makes it unsafe to build much upon
its langnage in a matter oi this kind. It may be that Macrobius knew
our commentary, and yet purposely put fuller and clearer expositione
into the mouth of his Servius. It is also possible that the commentary
as we have it was not published until the beginning of the fifth
century nu.

'Phe existing ¹commentary falls into two parts, one of which may
for convenience be termed the Vulgate; while the other consiste of
certain additions to the Vulgata, found in manuscripts of the uinth
and tenth centurias, and in quality equal either to the Vulgata or

to the commentary of Philargyrins. These additions were published
with the Vulgata in the year 1600 by Daniel, since whose time the
