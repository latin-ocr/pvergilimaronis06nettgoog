xxvi LIFE OF VIRGIL.

collect other evidence of this fact drawn from coincidenoes ol laugnage
between Propertius and Virgil.

11126 and 25 11. Augustus was absent in Spain, and wrote to Virgil
pressing him to send him either his first sketch of the Aeneid, cr any
paragraph or passage he pleased.⁸ Virgil reinsed,‘ urgiug that hc had
as yet nothing sufficiently finished‚ and dwelling cn the vastneas of the
material, and the new studies that 111 was about tc give to the subject.

The second, fourth, and sixth books were, however, at length read
to Augustus aud Octavia. This mnst have been after the death oi the
young Marcellus in 23 ac. When Virgil cameto the famous passage,
“ Tu Marcellus eris,'’ Octavia is said to have fallen into along swccn.¹⁵

'l'he events ci 19 111. are alluded to in the sixth and seventh books
(6. 794, 7. 606), which shows that Virgil was still busy with this part
oi the Aeneid till within a short time oi his death. Ribbeck supposes
that hs was also engaged in the latter years of his life upon a fresh
edition oi the Georgica However this may be, there seems no reason
to doubt that the end of the fourth Georgic was altered in or
after the year 26, when 1111 poet Gallus came to his tragical and
untimely end. The original conclusion cf the book,‚whioh in some
way or other bad been intended by Virgil as acompliment to Gallus,
was, at the instance oi Augustus, cut ont, and the episode 11 Aristaeus
substituted for it.⁸

In the year 19 Virgil had intended tc traval into Greece' and Asia
Minor, with the view cf spending three years there in finishing and
polishing the Aeneid.⁷ This done, he hoped to devote the rest oi his
life tc philosophy. But it was ncttcbe. At Athens he met Augustus,
who was returning from the East, and decided to return with him to
Italy. On avery hot September day he went to Megara, 1111111111-
warda 1111 111. Η1 was worse when he arrived, after an uninterrnpted
voyage, at Brundisium, where 111 died a few days afterwards, on the
2011111 September.

⁶ Suetonius 31, “ cui (Augusto) tamen multo post perfectaque demum materia tres
omnino libros recitavit, secundum quartum ct scutum, scd hunc notabili Octaviae
adiectione, quae cum recitationi interesset, ad illos de fflio suoversus ‘Tu Marcellus

1111111111. Nam laudes Galli habuit locus 1111 qui nunc Orphei continet fabulam,
quae inserta est postquam irato Augusto Gallus occisus est.”
