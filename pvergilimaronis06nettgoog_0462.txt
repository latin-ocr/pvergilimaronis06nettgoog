At liquidi fontes et stagna virentia musco

Adsint, et tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus,

Palmaque vestibulum aut ingens oleaster inumbret, so
Ut, cum prima novi ducent examina reges

Vere suo, ludetque favis emisse iuventus,

Vicina invitet decedere ripa calori,

Obviaque hospitiis teneat frondentibus arbos.

In medium, seu stabit iners, seu profluet umor, 25
Transversas salices et grandia conice saxa,

Pontibus ut crebris possint consistere et slas

Pandere ad aestivum solem, si forte morantis

Sparserit aut praeceps Neptuno inmerserit Eurus.

Haec circum casiae virides et olentia late co
Serpulla et graviter spirantis copia thymbrae
