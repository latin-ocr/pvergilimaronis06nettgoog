There are similar correspoudsnces between Servius and Gellius, of
which the following may be taken as a specimen:

Gellius 2. 13. 1, 21 antiqui oratores, historiaeque aut carminum
scriptores etiam unum filium filiamve liberos multitudinis numero

. appellarunt. He then illustratos from Sempronius Asellio.

Servius, A. 10. 5321 liberos etiam unum dicimus filium, adeo nt
Terentius etiam filiam dixerit, ut in Hecyra, “qui illum dignum
decreverint, snos oui liberos committerent

FLAVIUS CAPER, VELIUS LONGUS.

Flavius Caper and Velius Longus belong to the age of Trajan. 01
Caper, who is known only as a grammarian, not as a commentator ou
virgil, very little need be said here, the less as the few remarks which
are quoted from him by Servius oan be shown to be, iu all probability,
borrowed from other sources. Expleta 00010100, 111 Aen. 6. 545, Caper
took to mean 10100001 0100011001 011 explanation which, as we have
soen above, is given by Nonius, p. 298. There is, however, nothing to
show thet Nonius is borrowing from Caper here. And the same may
be said of Caper’s remark ou A. 9. 709, that the neuter form elipeum
aud not tho maso. clipeus should be read there, which coincides with
Nonius, p. 195. 11111011] his observation (Serv. A. 10. 344, 788) 011 the
forms semaco· and semen may be traced to Verrius Flaccus (Festus

Resides his elegant treatise on orthography‚ which has 1100010110-
1111101)Γ preserved, and a work de 000 antiquae lectionis,Velius Longus was
the author of a commentary on the Aeneid mentioned by Charisius
pp. 88,175. 01 this work several notes are preserved in Macrobius
