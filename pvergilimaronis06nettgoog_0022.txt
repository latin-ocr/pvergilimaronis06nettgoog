xviii LIFE OF VIRGIL.

bnt, so far as it goes, the information which they courcy corresponds
accurately enough with that given by Suetonius.

Such are the sources from which I have drawn the following short
account oi the life of Virgil.

Publius Vergilius Maro wu‘s born on the fifteenth of October, in the
year 70 aa, in which Cn. Pompeius Magnus and M. Licinius Crassus
were for the first time consuls, at Andes, a pagus in the territory of
Mantua.⁴ The name Audes is Celtic,⁶ and so apparently is Vergilius.
The poet’s iether was a man oi humble origin. According to some
accounts he was a worker in pottery, but most authorities represented
him as the hired serrant oi one Magius, a courier,⁶ whose daughter
Magia he at length married. His mother's name is doubtless in great
part responsible for the mediaeval notion which made Virgil (“ Magius
filius ‘') a magician.

If we may trust the authorities mentioned by Suetonius, Virgil's
father managed to onrich himself by buying up tracts of woodland
and by lrceping bees. There is nothing improbable in this state-
ment, us the time when he was thus engaged may well have been
the era oi the Sullan proscriptione, when land would be cheap. It is
probabis thet Virgil’s love for the country was fostered by his early
surroundings.

Althongh oi humble origin himself, VirgiI’s father, like Horace’s,
seems to have been anxious to gire his son the best education attain-
able. Virgil spent his boyhood at Cremona,⁷ and took his toga uirilis
there on his fifteenth'birthday (Oct. 15, Bo. 55), ou the very day
when the poet Lucretius died.⁸ By en odd coincidence, Pompeius and
Crassus were a second time consuls in this year. From Cremona

Virgil went to Milan, aud shortly afterwards ‚to Rome. Here he
studied rhetoric under the best masters,⁹ among others (if we may
believe the short biography given in two Berne manuscripts) Epidius,
who also numbered Antonius and Octavianus among his pupils. The
earliest specimen quoted oi his poetry is s couplet said to hare been

⁴ Suetonius 2, “iu pago qui Andes dicitur et abest a Mantus non procn1.'' Jerome
a. Abr. 1948 “ Vergilius Maro in pago qui Andes dicitur, hant procul a Mantua” The
memoir attributed to Probus calls Andes u cion, and places it some thirty miles
from Mantua. But Audes must have been much nmrer to Mantua: see “Ancient
Lisos of Vergil„ ἀπ’ p. 33.

⁰ Suetonius 1, “quem quidam opificem figulum,p1urec Magi cniusdam viatoris
initio mercennarium, mor ob industrium generum tradiderunt, egregieque substantiae
silvis coemendis et apibus curandis auxisse reculam.'’ (I conjecture &stantium . .

¹ Perhaps his mother Magia was a native of Cremona: a Numerius Magius of
that city is mentioued by Caesar B. G. 1. 24.
