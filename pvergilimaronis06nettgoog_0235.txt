Montibus haec uestris: soli cantare periti

Arcades. Ο mihi tum quam molliter ossa quiescant,
Vestra meos olim si fistula dicat amoresl

Atque utinam ex vobis unus, vestrique fuissem ac
Aut custos gregis, aut maturae vinitor uvael

Certe, sive mihi Phyllis, sive esset Amyntas?

Seu quicumque fuson-quid tum, si fuscus Amyntas?
Et nigrae violae sunt et vaccinia nigra—

Mecum inter salices lenta sub rite iaceret ; 40
Serta mihi Phyllis legeret, cantaret Amyntas.

Hic gelidi fontes, hic mollia pratu, Lyconi,

Hic nemus; hic ipso tecum consumerer aevu.

Nunc insanus amor duri me Martis in armis
