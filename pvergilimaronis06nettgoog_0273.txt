INTRODUOTION. 153

The soil is rich (in the supposed case), requiring and repayiug work ε
the bullocks ere tc be strong: the very line in which they are mentioned
lebours with the intensity of their exertion‚ which is to begin with the
year itself and to be repeated in the summer: and when the clods have
thus been a second time turned up and exposed to the sky, the sun is
to perform its part in the great confederecy of teil, darting its meridien
beams upon them, end beking them thoroughly till they crumble into
dust. Having delivered his precepts for ploughing‚ following, stubble-
turning, harrowing‚ crosa-ploughing, irrigating, and draining‚ he re-
flecte again on the arduousness oi e fermer's duties‚ and proceeds
egein to lay a mythologioal foundation tor their support. Following
whet is apparently a different, ii notan inconsistent line of legend,
he refers the origin of labour not to Deucalion's time, but tc the
coming in of the silver age under Jupiter. Iu Saturn’s days mankind
had one common stock, end carth yielded every thing freely: Jove
was the first to break up the land by human skssl, using care to sharpen
men’s wite, nor letting the realm which he had made his own grow
dull under the weight of lethsrgy. Then came the divers arts oi life:
so Toil conquered the world, relentless Toil, and Want that grinde in
adversity. The acoms had begun to fail iu the secred foreste and
Dodona to withhold her sustenance‚ when Ceres taught men to plough
and eovv. Soon the corn itself hed hardship and sickness leid upon it:
those plagues cerne in which gave the former no respite‚ and, it he
relaxes his vigilance, drive him beck into a barbarism which resembles
the golden age only in what it is without. ‘⁴ Unlese your reka ie ever
ready to exterminate weeds, your shout to scere away birds, your hook
to restrain the shade which derkens the land, and your preyers to cell
down rein, poor man, you will gaze on your neighbour's big heap of
grain with unavailing envy, betake yourself to the woods again, and
shake the oak to allay your hunger.'’ The semeindomitable enthusiasm
animatos the poet, when, with the Second Book, e fresh division of his
subject opens upon him. In a second invocation he sees himself and
Bacchus as follow-labourers taking part in every detail of the vintage.
“ Come hither, Father of the winepress! strip off thy busirim, bare
thy legs, eud plunge them with me in the new must.” He surveys
his new province in ell its length and breadth3 and the result is a
fresh accees of exulting energy. “ Come then, husbandmen, and learn
the culture proper to each according to its kind, and so mellow your
wild fruits by cultivation, nor let the ground lie idle. What joy to
plant Ismarus ull over with the progeny oi the winegod‚ end clothe
the mighty sides of Taburnus with a germont of olives! ’¹ No jot ot
the difficulty is abated or omitted: the objects of labour are mountaine,
which themselves suggest the notior of an arduous undertaking: but
