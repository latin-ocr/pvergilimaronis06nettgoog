BUOOLIOA. EOL. IV. 51

the mamiage of Antonius with Octavia, and the union ot Octavianus with Scribonia
hed taken placa not long before. [The most ancient commentatore, it we may judge
by the notes iu Macrobius (S. 3.7. 1.) Servius,aud the Berua scholia, were not agraed
whether the poem was ιο ιο referred to Octavianus, or to one or other of Pollio’s sons]
One of these, called Saloninus from his father's capture of Salona in Dalmatia, died
in his iufauey, while ιιο other, (l. Asinius Gallus, who is said ιο have spoken oi
himselfto Asconius Pedianus aa ιιο person meant, lived to bedisoussed by Augustus
aa his possible successor (Tac A. l. 13), aud flually fell a viatim ιο ιιο jeulousy ol
Tiberius (ib. 6. 23). Octadauus’ marriage lssued in the birth of dulia: ceurae

“ child, il it uas ever born, was the child not 'ol Antonius, but of Marcellus, her

former husband, by whom she uas pregnant at the time cf her second marriage.
Any of these births, sofar as we ean see, may have appeared at the time ιο a
courtly or enthusiastio poet a sufficient centre round which te group the hopes
already assumed to ιο rising iu men's minda, and though the next three years may
have made a differeuee iu this respect, the poem would still continue ιο ιο in its
general features the embodiment of a feeling not yet extinguished, aud as such
might well be published along with the other Eclogues. The peace of Brundisium
itself was not so mueh the cauae of this enthusiasm us the occasion of its manifes-
tatiou-the partial satisfactiones a yeerning uhich had long been felt, not merely
the transient awakening ol desires hitherto dormant How far such hopes may
have been connwted with the expectation of a Messiah opens a wide question. Tho
coincidence between Virgil's language and that of the Old Testament propheta is
sufficieutly striking: but it may be doubted whether Virgil uses any image ιο
which a elmsieal parallel cannot be found.

The allusione ιο ιιο propheciae of the Sibyl eud ιο ιιο doctrine of the Annus
Magnus will be found explained iu their places. Some features ol the poem, which
seem to deserte attention, ara notieed in the note ou v. 18.
