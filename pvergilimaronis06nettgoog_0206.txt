86 Ρ. VERGILI MARON IS

Τ. Aret ager ; vitio moriens sitit a'e'ris 1101110;

Liber pampineas inridit oollibus umbras:

Phyllidis adventu nostrae nemus omne virebit,

Iuppiter et laeto descendet plurimus imbri. 00
0. Populus Aloidae gratissima, vitis lancha,

Formosae myrtus Veneri, sna laurea Phoebo ;

Phyllis amat corylos3 »illas dum Phyllis amabit,

Neo myrtus vincet corylos, neo laurea Phoebi.

P. Fraxinus in silvis pulcherrima, pinus in hortis, 00

Populus in fluviis, abies in montibus altis;

Saepius at si me, Lycida formose, revisas,

Fraxinus in silvis cedat tibi, pinus in hortis.
