88 Ρ. VERGILI MARON IS

'I'ha Eclogue itsell is sc far parallel to s. 5 that it contains a speciosos amachan,
consisting not, like Eelcgues 3 aud 7, of a number oi short efforts, but oi two con·
tinuons stralus oi eqnal lengths- the difference between a dialogus and aset oration
followed by a set reply-suagested perhaps by Theocr. Id 9, where there are two
songs of seven lines each. But the detail here is much more complicated, each of
tha poanm being composed ot ten stanzas (sc to call them), consisting respectively ol'
two, three, four, and live lines, and separated from each other by a burdeu. The
arrangement of the stanzas however is not quite the same in the two poems, as the last
three stannus ci Damon’s song consist respectively oi four, five, and three lines with
their bardans, while in Alphesiboeus’ the order of the concluding mansas runs, fisa
lines, three lines, and four lines.

The circumstances under which this amoebean exorciso tahas place are ncl stated
(note on v. 14). The two songs have no formal connexion. though baflled love is the
theme ol' both. The flrst is imitated from various passages in the first, third. aud
eleventh Idyls oi Theocritus, the second entirely irom Idyl 2, which Virgil abridges
and flts with a more prospercus conclusion.

Ehenllynxes (v. 3) and the mention of Oeta (ι. 30) show that the scenery is not
