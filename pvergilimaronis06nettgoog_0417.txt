Continuoque notas et nomina gentis inurunt,

Et quos aut pecori malint summittere habendo,

Aut aris servare sacros, uut scindere terram 1oo
Et campum horrentem fractis invertere glaebis.

Cetera pascuntur viridis armenta per herbas:

Tu quos ad studium atque usum formabis agrestem,
lam vitulos hortare, viamque insiste domandi,

Dum faciles animi iuvenum, dum mobilis aetas, roe
Ao primurn laxos tenui de vimine circlos

Oervici subnecte3 dehinc, ubi libera oolla

Servitio adsuerint, ipsis e torquibus aptos

Iunge pares, et coge gradum conferre iuvencos3

Atque illis iam saepe rotae ducantur inanes 170
