THE ANUIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. oi

TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DONATUS.

The commentary cf Tiberius Claudius Donatus on the Aeneid,
written towards the end of the fourth century an. for the benefit of
his son Tiberius Claudius Maximus Donatianus, differs in its scope
and aim from notes such as those of the Verona scholia, Servius, or
Philargyrins. This writer’s main object is to bring out fully the
meaning of his author by writing a lengthy paraphrass iu prose,
intended not only to explain the meaning of the poet, but to exhibit
the rhetorical connection of the clauses. For instance, on Aen. 1. 291
he takes peius to show that the words of Jupiter, “quin aspera Iuno
. . . Consilium in melius referet,'' are meantes a consolatory reply to
the complaint of Venus “unius ob iram Prodimur.” The commentator
aime always at explaining the connection of ideas, and showing
generally how Virgil’s arrangement and the development of his
narrative coincide with the fitness of things. Elementary points oi
mythology are noticed in this commentary, but, so far as I have
observed, there is very little information ou grammar and antiquities.

A modern render will probably find the work of Tiberius Donatus dull
and unprofitable to a degree quite unusual in the case of any commentary
on a secular author. But his own professione with regard to ir are

interesting as throwiug some light ou the condition of scholarship aud
education in the fourth century an. He says iu his preface¹ that he
intends his remarks to be mainly educational. 'I'he schoclmasters
give their scholare nothing of any value, while the commentatore,
writing for the purpose not of instruction but of research, however
praiaeworthy their real, have left their remarks in a comparatively
marcessible condition. He begs his son to compare his work with

that of the older commentatore, and to judge for himself what he
prefers to follow ιιι the one cr the other
This commentary was, according to its author’s own scemeca?

in Aeneidos libris quasi quidam solus ao purior intellectus expressus est, silere
melius erat quam loquendo crimen arrogantis (arrogantieel) incurrere. Sed eum
ιὰιοήιιιιιι nihil magistros discipulis conferre quod sapiat, scriptores autem com-
mentariorum conducendi studio, sed memoriae suae causa quaedam favorabili
studio, multa mmen involute reIIquisse, haec, illi cadmina, tui causa conscripsi,
non ut sola perlegas, sed ut ex collatione habita intellegas quid tibi ex illorum,
quidve ex paterno lubere sequendum sit'' (Prefaoe to the Commentary).
