cii THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

written hastily and with many omissione. It was the work oi his old
age, and he therefore hastened to finish it, intending ιο make good its
shortcomings in afuturo work. This was to include historice of the
Virgilian heroes, accounts oi the rivers, mountains, countries and
towns mentioned in the Aeneid, and remarks on other points oi
' antiquities or oi general interest. Itis very important to observe that
these notes were ιο be taken irem ancient commentaries. It is possible
that the young Donatianus was content with the first instalment oi his
futher’s learning, bnt modern scholare will ieel inclined, in their own
interest, to regret that Donatus did not begin with his extraots from
the older commentatore. For these, it would seem, he never lived to
complete.

IUNIUS PHILARGYRIUS.

The fragment oi a commentury on the Eologues, bearing the title
Philargyrii Erplmvutiocee, is preserved in three manuscripts (Lauren-
ticwus, plut. XLV. cod. 14, loch century3 Parisinus 7‚960‚10thcsntnry;
Parisinus 11,308‚ oi the seme date). And an incomplete commentary

on the Georgics, of excellent quality, hut with large gaps, which gives

the impressiou oi the work as we have it being a series of extrects,
has been since the time of Ursinus assigned likewise ιο Iunius

Philargyrius. M. Thomas, in his essay upon Servius (p. 277), observes
that the name oi Philargyrius is not, in a single MS, prefixed to these
scholia This fact would of course,ii taken by itseli, be sufficient to
Ι throw grave doubt upon our right ιο assign the notes to Philargyrius.

Βιιι it must also be observed that the Berne scholis, of which more
anon, often quote from similius Fluyrae, whom scholare usually
identify with the Iunius Philargyrins oi the commentary on the
Elclogues. And the notes oi Iunilius Flagrus very citen‘ coincide

pari praeparem cura quae propter supra dictam eausam videor omisisse. Sic enim

of Chemnitz, Basel, 1547.)

⁴ 1 have observed the following instances of correspondence between the notes
attributed ιο Iunilius Flaprus in the Beroe scholia, and those found cu the sams
passages in the commentsry bearing the name of Iunius Philargyrius:

Ecl. l. 203 Georg. 1. 58, 292-3, 2953 2 16ος ιι 5, 113, 280, 392, 408, 461 (ι)
