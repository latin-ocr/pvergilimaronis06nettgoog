the ancieuts, at least before the time oi Virgil,⁴ for pastoral dulness
thau for pastoral ideality‚ becanm the pcet’s goldon land, where imagi-
nation found a refuge from the harsh prosaic lile of the present.
Gradually the pastoral was treated as a sort cl exercisegrcund for
young authore, who supposed themselves, iu the words ol an old com·
mentator ou Spenser‚'⁵ ιο be ‘⁶ following the example ol the best aud
most ancient poete, which devised this kind of writing, being both so
base tor the matter and hemely for tho manner, attho first to try their
habilities: and as young birds that be newly crept out of the nest, by
little first prove their tendet· wiugs, before they make a greater flight.’'
It was indeed little more than the form iu which the poet made himself
known to the world, the pseudonym under which it was thought

Whether it is ncw to be registered as an extinct species, at least iu
England, is perhaps a question cf lauguage rather thau ol fact. The

and the habits ci the country are represented ιο us in poems‚ remind-

Eclogue and Pastoral are heard nc longer, nor is it easy tc conceive of
a time when the associatione connected with them are likely again to
find favour with Englishmen.

remarked, before pastoral poetry had migrated from Syracuse. But iu
Virgil it at once attained a height which left comparatively little to be
