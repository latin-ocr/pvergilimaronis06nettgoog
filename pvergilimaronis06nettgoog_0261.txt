INTRODUOTION. 141

prognostica of the westher which occupies the lat-tor part of Virgil's
FirstBook. The very first words oi Aratus' poem, οὐχ ὁράας, evidently
suggested the familiar appeal aecae vides, which Virgil, in imitation of

· Lucretius, introduces more than once in the Georgies. The whole of

the prognostica that follow, signs of wind, signs of rain, signs of fair
westher, signs from sounds by land or by sea, signs from the ssight, the

motion, or the cry of birds, signs from tho actions of bessts, reptiles, ’

aud insecta, signs from the flames of lampa, and the appearances on
water, signs from the sun aud moon at their rising and at their setting,
are all given nearly as Aratus has given them, though the manner in
which they are dealt with is Virgil's own. We know not how closely
Aratus may have followed his original, if indeed he had an original in
this ns in his other poem; but however much or however little scientihc
precision may have suffered from his laugnage, which is that of a
tolerably successful imitator of the old epic style, sornewhat diffuse, but
on the whole perspicuous‚ and not greatly over-wronght, the arrange·
ment of his subject is sufficiently like that which we should expect to
see in a prose treatise, so that the charms of variety are occasionally
sacrifioed to the claime of practica] utility, the same thing being men·
tioned more than once where it happens to belong tc more than oue
cluster of phenomena. But Virgil pushes the right of a poet over his
materiale iar beyond Aratus. He deligbts in the profusion of pic· 1
turesque images which is to be found in Aretus’ collection of prognos-
tics, and he makes free use of them for his own purposes3 but those
purposes are rather poetical than properly dida'ctic. If the readcr is
not wearied, it matters little that he is left in ignorance oi part of what
it concern'ed him to know. Any one who will compare the hundred
and fourteen lines in the Diosemeis, on tbe signs given by the moonand
the eun, with the thirty-seven in the First Book of the Georgius on the
same topic, will see at once that the two writers must have proposed to
themselves different objects. The first thought of the one was to com-
municate information; the first thought oi the other was to impert

⁶ pleasure.

In the case of a third writer whom Virgil is supposed to have
imitated, circumstances have been less favonrable to us. Quintilian,
in the well-known chapter in which he revicws the various authors of
Grecos and Rome, aske whether Virgil can be called an unsucccssfnl
follower of Nicander. But of Nicander's Georgics, which is evidently
the work referred to, we possess only fragments3 and these, with the
exception oi one or two oi the least important, relate to any part of
the subject rather thau to those of which Virgil has chosen 1611661-
to such trees as the beech, the mulberry, the palm, and the chestnut,
to turnips, aud gourds, and cabbeges, to flowers of 611 kinds, and to
