LIFE OF VIRGIL.

’1111 1111001 011 most authentia life 01 virgil now existing is that pre-
fixed to the commentarios of Aelius and Tiberius Donatus, 'I'his
memoir, which was formerly attributed to Ti. Donatus, is now by the
almost universal consent 01 scholare assigned to Suetonius¹ There is

- also 0 Life prefixed to the commentary which bears the name 01 Ρ10110,

which may also be ultimately based upon Suetonius, but whose author,
whoever he was 011 whatever authorities he followed, cannot be
acquitted of either ignoranee or carelessness.¹ Anda short memoir is
also prefixed to the commentary 01 Servius, which, although it is for
the most part merely a confused abridgment 01 110 work 01 Suetonius,
contains some additional matter, notably the statement that the lines
about Helen in the second Aeneid (vv. 566 foll.) were Virgil’s own,
and were struck out 01 110 manuscript by Varius and Tucca.

Tho memoir by Suetonius, in the form in which we now possess it,
does 101 perhaps contain all that Suetonius wrote about Virgil, but so
faras 11 extends its velue is all-important. For Suetonius, 0 diligent
