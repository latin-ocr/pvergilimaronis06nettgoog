150 GEORGICA.

chiefly passed, at the same time that we see the fact to be susceptible of
another use, as showing how he may have been drawn to rural poetry,
without having felt a decided love for it. But it is difficult to conceive
that a man in whose mind the ambition oi imitation, the charm oi recol-
lected reading, and a teste ior conventional conceptione filled so large a
space can have found his delight and solace, at least to the extent sup-
posed, in sympathy with external nature The unreality of the pastoral
life iu the Eclogues does not indeed prove the existence of similar nn-

l reality in the Georgics3 but it prepares us to expect it. Probably »

Ι more strongly expressed than that to whiehI have already adver-ted, .

there is no passage in the Georgics in which sympathy with nature is

where he contrasts the vocaticn cl Lucretius with his own. He prays
that he may delight in the country and the streame that freshen the
valleys—that he msylove river and woodland withan unambitioss love.
He siglis for Sperchias and Taygetus, the revel-ground oi Spartan
maidens, aud longa for some one who will set him down in the coel glens
of Haemus, and shelter him with the gient shcde of its bonghs. He talks
of the bliss of the man who has won the friendship of the rnral gods,
Pan and old Silvanus, and the sisterhood ol nympha. He occupies the
rest of the book with the prcises of the country life, its tranquillity and
purity, its constant round of pleasant employments, its old historic and
legendary renown. But he has already painted the destiny olaseieutille

f inquiror into nature in colours which can scarcely bc intended to be
less glowing, and declared that his first love is centred there. The very
distinctness with which Lucretius is indicated as the ideal after which

he primarily aspiresis itself a presumption that the aspiration is in some
sort genuine. There is, indeed, something strange and sad, if this were
the place to dwell on it, in the spectacle of aman contemplating the Irucre·
lian system and an attempt to realize the old rural belief aa two feasible
alternatives, and leaving the choioe to he determined by his mental eonsti-
tution: stranger, perhaps, and sadder still, ifwe suppose him to heusing
words without a distinct conseiousness of their full meaning, and to be
thinking really of the comparative aptitude for poetieal purposes of the
two opposite aspecta of nature. But though such a state of mind has
no affinity tc the terrible earnestness ot Lucretius himself, it is nol
uncharacteristic of a would-be philosopher: while the touch which im·
mediately follows, the praise of a country life as adording no scope for
the paine of pity or of cnvy, seems to show a liugering sympathy with
philosophie doctrine even after he had resigned himself to an unphilo·
sophie life. Nonis this the only passage in which we find traces of a
yearning aiter philosophy as the true sphere of a poet. The song of
Iopas in the First Book of the Aeneid where several lines are repeated
from the passage we have just been considering, shows that the eon-
