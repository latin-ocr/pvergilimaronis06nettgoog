11 would be interesting to know whether the fourthv book oi Macro·
bins, and remarks such as those which I have quoted from Servius,
were taken from the hook of our rhetorical worthies, Titianus and
Catulinus.⁸ Whether this is the case or 00, there 000 10 00 doubt that
this style of criticism is one of which Probus or any of the older com·
mentators would have been ashamed‚ aud is the characteristic offspriug
of au age in which all crastiua affort has died out.

Itis in all respects more profitable 10 stndy the material common 1ο
110 Verona scholia, Philargyrius, Macrobius, and Servius: material
which Ι suppose to 10,οο 10000010110 deposit which the scholarship
of the first aud second century had left. In dealing with this matter it
is noticeable that 110 oommentary of Servius, as compared with the
notes ot Macrobius or the Verona scholia, tends to abbreviata, to
cnrtail, and to omit the names oi authorities. Servius is 00 110 whole
0 00001, 101 10 10 001 0 full commentatum and we should be fortunate
indeed could we exchange all his work for the Verona scholia in their
complete form. The valna of his commentary is derived almost ι
entirely from what it preserves oi the earlier Roman scholarship3 and
the amount oi this, jndgiug by what a comparative method enables us

Ribbeck and Teuffel assignto the eighth century. This writer names
aa the three commentatore from whom he has made extracta, Titus
Gallus, Gaudentius, and Iunilius Flagrus oi Milan. Iunilius Flagrus,
who is mentioned by the compiler as his chief authority, is now gener·
