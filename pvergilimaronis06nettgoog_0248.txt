128 ΟΝ THE LATER

Quae, licet interdum contexto vimine clausa,
(lum parrae patuere iores, oen libera ferri
Norit, et agrestis iuter volitare volucres,

‘Scit rursus remeare domun, tectumque subire
Viminis, et caream totis praeponere silvis.’'

It is noticeable that the two sougs, which are continuone, are of exactly
the same length, like those in Virgil’s fifth and eighth Eelogues.

Iu the third Eclogue Nemesianus has imitated Virgil’s sixth. Three
shepherds lind Pau asleep‚ take his pipe, and vaiuly try to perform ou
it: he awalres, aud immediately offers to play, taking for his subject
the praises oi Bacchus, whose name the copyist has accordingly pre·
fixed to the Elelogue. The song, which is of uo great length, being
given in the ‘oratio recta,' not, like Virgil’s‚ throwu into the form of
a rapid summary, speaks of the birth and iuiaucy oi the god, aud ot
the productiori oi the grapa, the first treading of which is described.

· There is considerable pictoresque power in various parts oi the song,

which admits, as Wernsdorl remarks, of illustratiou from various
extant gems. Here is a picture oi the child in the arms oi Silenus.

“ Quin et Silenus parvum veneratus alumnum
Aut gremio foret, aut resupinus sustinet ulnis,
Et vocat ad risum digito, motuque quictem
adlicit, aut tremulis quassat crepitacula palmis:
Oui deus adridens horrentis pectore setas
valiat, aut digitis auris astringit acutas,
Applauditve manu mutilum ceput ant breve ruentum,
Et simas tenero collidit pollice nares”

Eveuing ends the Ilclogua which Fonteuelle rather boldly prouounces -
to be superior iu clegauce oi invention to its Virgilian prototypa. It

is difficult to see the appropriatcness oi the praises of Bacchus iu the

mouth oi Pan, thopgh they might have come with some grace from

Silenus; while the pictorial features, being such cs are found repre-

sented iu works oi art, may perhaps be due as much to artistic tradition

as to the imagination of the poet.

The fourth Eclogue, Eros, is again amoebean, Mopsus and Lycidas
siuging oi their loves, Meroe and Iolas. The strophas are short, live
lines each, and each has the same hurdeu, ‘Cautet amat quod quisque:
levant et carmina curas! The topics are, as usual, chiefly Theocriteau
aud Virgilian, the transitorincss ol beauty, the universality of passionate
pursnit‘, the lover siuging iu thc beat when all else is shcltered‚ and
the employment oi the various resources of magio. As in the eighth
Eclogue oi Virgil, there is no formal conclusion.

Sachare the somewhat meogre products yielded by Roman bucolic
poetry aiter Virgil’s time—compositione as uureal asVirgil’s own, with·
