pastoral poetry, if by pastoral poetry is meant a truthful dramatic
representation of ono of the simplest forms of life. How far it vitiatos

the character of tho Eclogues as puro poetry, irrespectivo of the class
to which they profess to belong, is a further question, and oue which
ought not to be deoided till wo have seen how much it may involve.
If the Eclognea are to be condemned ou this ground, itis hard to see
how we are to excuse a work like Gymbeline. If the somowhat broad
shield of the romantio drama is sufficient to cover tho latter, room may
perhaps be found under it for the former. No incongruity of which
Virgil has boen guilty can be so glaring or so fatal to those notione of
reality which the very form of historical knowledge suggests as that
produced by the juxtaposition of the modern Italian, not only with the
legendary Briton, but with tho Roman of the earlier empire. Itis not
that the lawe of timeand circumstance are simply violated, but that
they are violated in such a way that the result appears to nsincou·
coivable as well as false, two types, belonging to different periods of
the same natiou, and as such forming the subjecta of an obvious
. historioal contrast, being imagined for the moment to coexist, not in
tho other world, as in the various Dialogues of the Dead, where this
incongruity enters into the very idea of the composition, but iu a world
which, if not our own, resembles it in all its essential features as a
theatra for human action aud passion. Yet criticism seems now to be
agreed that the very glaringncss of such incongruitics, though doubt
less attributable as much to ignorance or recklessnoss as to any
profound desigu, ought only to taach us to divest ourselves of all
extraneous prepossessious, and examine the picco as a representation of
human nature apart from the conditione of time, just as when we look
at sorno of tho early pointings our sense of beanty need notbe ulti·
mately disturbed by our cousciousness that the actions pertrayed in
the two parts of the pictura arc obviously not simultaneous bntsuc·
cesaive. Virgil, of course, according to our ordinary nomenclatore,
is a classical, not a romantio poet3 but the fact will hardly he held to
exclude him from the bcnefit of a similar plea, if indeed it should not
suggest fresh matter for consideration with regard to the laws

¹ generally, and probably with justice, supposed to distinguish the two

great schools of Auoient and Modern Art.

This, however, is not the only lrind of confusion by which the pastoral
reality of tha Eologues is disturbed or destroyed. Not only is tho
Siciliae mixed up with the Italian, bnt tho shepherd is mixed up with
the poet. 'Phe danger was one to have been apprehended from tho first.
So soon as pastoral poetry came to be recognized as a distinct species, the
men of letters who cultivated it, perhaps themselves grammarians or
professional critice, were likely to yicld to the temptation of pointing
