THE ANOIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL. lxix

and essert that much of them is, in the lest rescrt, distinctly traccable
to Pliny and Probus. Taking the third book (De indiscretis Geraribus)
first, we may observo that the subject of doubtful gender had oocu-
pied the attention of grammarians in the first century un. So much
may be inferred from the language of Quintilian (9. 3. 6), who speaks
as if he had manuals before him in which the subject was treated.
One of these may have been the book of Probus, De dubiis pausatus
(probably part af his Silua Observationum), cited by Priscian (1, p. 169,
171 Keil). Lat us praeced to consider the relation between this work
and the third book of Nonius.

Priscian, in the passage already quoted, gives a list which he took,
aslis says, from the treatises of Caper and Probus cte dubiis pasteribus.
This list is partly alphabetical. “Vetustissimi in multis, nt diximus,
supra dictarum terminaticnum inveniuntur confudisse genera, nulla
significationis differentia coacti sed sola auctoritate, nt hie et baec
aspergo, alvus, creua adeps vel adipes, chartaceum, einis vel cicer,
cervia, callis, arua, calu, cipressus, platanus, populus, laurus, aquila,
aricia carbasus, eolus, bie et baeu cassis, elusis, luia et liaeo conscia (?)‚
callis, saraae, fruteta, pree, fraus frontis, liic et baec lemnus, imbres,
lam. Accius “ non calida latice lautus ε ” umbus, linter, lepus, apaan,
leo, perusinus, perdia, bia et haec palumbae, bio ct haee saca, rudeus
ὅπρᾶτονος, samus, supparus περιώμιον et boc supparum, seaeoe, stirps, torris ,
atalae, tiaras, Tibris, uacuis, torques, trames, uesper, hi et hoe uepres.
This list is alphabetioal, with three exceptione. After cupressis come
platanus, populus, laruas, aquila: after lepus, aquus, and after Tibris,
munis: a faetta which Ι shall recnr in a moment

This list only includes instances of confusion between the masculine
and feminine gandera. Priscian goes on to give instantes of con·
fusim between the masculine and neuter, or the masculine, feminine,
and neuter: guttur, murmur, glomus, fretus, dorsus, palus, Hister,
Rhenus, Tanagrae, Metaurus, Iberus, Vulturnus, Oceanus, iubar, liquor,
papauer, pertus, pecus, retis, secus, pecus, sat.

These lists are (with the exceptione noticed) alphabetioal, and so
far resemble the third book of Nonius. And af the words thus
catalogued by Priscian in this passage, thirty-one out of seventytwo'
ι are to be found in Nonius. I might have said thirty-one out of sixty·
eight, for the words platanus, populus, laurus, and aquaila (which are
absent iu Nonius), arc intruded in Priscian in a placcwhere, alpha·
betically, they have no right to stand, the alphabetical order proceed-
ing properly from cupressus to uiuis.

Priscian distinctly tells ns that he has taken his lists from Caper and
Probus: and it would, therefore, bc easy to infer that the third book
of Nonius also comes from the same sources. But the question is
