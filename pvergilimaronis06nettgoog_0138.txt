18 ⁴ BUOOLIOA.

no hint in Suetonius or any other ancient authority¹ of a second
edition oi the Ecloguos. The fourth Eclogne was referred by all the
ancient commentatore to the consulship of Pollio, the name of Pollio
stands in tho text, and ean only be removed by violence. There is
nothing again, either in the style or the matter of the sixth or tenth
Eclognes, which can fairly be hold to jastify so strange a brooch with
an excellent historical tradition—H. N.]

There seems no reason to doubt that the order in which the Eclognes
now stand is that in which virgil himself arranged them, whatever bear·
ing that may have on the question of their relative dates. The last
line ol the fourth Georgic, as Wagner remarks, even without the support
ol a similar notice by Ovid, establishcs the fact that the first Eclogne
was intended to stand first and give, as it were, its tone to the whole3
tho exordium of the tenth Eclogue speaks for itscli. For the titles of
the various Eclognes, varying as they do in tho different MSS, tho
grammarians are donbtless te be held responsible. The name Balagrae,
which signifies merely select peems², in this case the partiens of the
Bucolic volume, is to be referred te the same authority.

Recent German critice, suchachbauer, in the treatisc already referred ·

to, and Ribbeck, hare supposed themselves to have found the traces of
symmetrical arrangement, amounting to something like strophieal corre·
spondence, throughout the Eclognes. That such a principle was prc-
seut to Virgil's mind during the composition of some of them, the
structure oi the amocbean part of Eclogues 3, 5, 7, and Sis sufficient to
prove: ner dees it seem an accident that the scraps of songs quoted in
Eclogue 9 fall into two pairs of three and five lines respectively; bnt

thetis no reason for secking symmetry in tbe Eclognes which are not
amoebean, and torturing the text in order to bring it out.⁸ It is true
that tho sense is more frequently ended with the line in the Eclognes

¹ Servius, in his Life, says, it is true, “cannen Bucolicum. . . . eum constat
triennio scripsisse et emcndoasc.” But the word cateridem (used also by Servius of
the Georgics) means only that Virgil put tho finishing touch to the Eelogucs, us
ho was presented by death from'doing to the Aeneid. ·

² See Forcelllni s. v. Eebga. The irrelevancy of tho term as applied te pastoral
poetry led Petrarch te acurious emendation, AEgloyaes, which he accordingly gave ss
tho title to his own Pastorals; and Sponsor, among others, followed the example.
Johnson, who remarks (Life ol A. Philips) that the word can only mean ‘the talk of
gosis? not, as it was intended, ‘ tho talk of geatherds,' might base remarkcd further,
that no such formation could have existed in Greek. The French spelling Egloqaes
may be otherwise explained.

³ Gcbsuer's theory obliges him in Ε. 10. 32, 33 to put a full stop after ‘periti'
connecting the second ‘Arcades’ with the words that follow. Most readers will, Ι
think, leel that the rhythmicol benuty of ‘soli motare periti Arcades' is worth far
more, to modern apprehensione at least, than any gain that ean bo supposed te
acerne from the strophical nnangemcnt oi an entire Eclogue.
