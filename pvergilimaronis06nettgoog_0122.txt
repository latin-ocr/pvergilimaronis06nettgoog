INTRODUCTION.

Tus history oi Pastoral Poetry shows us how easily the most natural
species oi composition may pass into the most artificial. Whatever
may have been its earliest beginnings—a question¹ which seems ιο

to have been recognized or cultivated as a distinct branch till the Greek
mind had passed its grem climacteric, aud the centre of intellectuat
life had been transferred from Athens to Alexandria. Yet as introduced
into the world by Theocritus, if modern¹ criticism is right in supposing
