Quid, qui, ne gravidis procumbat culmus aristis,
Luxuriem segetum tenera depascit in herba,

Cum primum sulcos aequant sata? quique paludis
Collectum umorem bibula deducit harena,

Praesertim incertis si mensibus amnis abundans 115
Exit, et obducto late tenet omnia limo,

Unde cavae tepido sudant umore lacunae?
