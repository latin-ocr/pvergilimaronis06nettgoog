The introduction oi men called Meliboeus and Tityrus talking about
Rome leaves us no roem to wonder at any further mixture oi incon·
grnities. Yet the lengths to which this confusion is pushed have been
overlooked by the majority of scholars; nor am Ι aware oi any one,
with the exception ol a writer in the Quarterly Review aud Mr.
Keightleyss who basset the matter in its true light. When Castel-
vetro, in the sixteeuth century, asserted that the favourite trees ol the
Eclogues, the beech, the ilex, the chestuut‚ and the pina, do not grew
about Mantua, subsequent critice were ready to reply⁸ that the features
ol the country may have changed in the lapse oi centuriae, and that
surely Virgil must know best. But such reasoning will hardly avail
against the absence of the green caves iu which the shepherd lies, or
the briery crags from which his goats hang, or the lofty mountains
whose lengthening shadows remind him of evening. These are the
nnmistakable features of Sicily, and no illnsion of historical criticism
will persuadens that they have changed their places, strangeas it is
to meet thern {in conjunction with real Mantnan scenery, with the
fiinty soil of Andes, and the broad, lazy current oi the Mincio, The
actual Mantua is surrounded hya lake: ite pastoral counterpart, like
Shakspeare’s Bohemia, seems to be on thesea, the stilluess of whose
waters enablcs the shepherds to sing undisturbed, as in Theocritus it
forms a contrast with the unresting sorrow ol the love-siek anchan-
tress. The same rulo, if rule it can be calladis observed in the
manners and institutione of the shepherds: there is the Italian
clement, and there is the Sicilian, added, as it were, to make it bucolic.
The Pales of the Italians and the Apollo Nomius of the Greeks, aa Mr.
Keightley again points out, retire together from the country, which
the death of Daphnis has left desolate: the two high-days of the
shepherds' calendar are the Greek festival oi the Nymphs and the
Roman Ambarvalia. It seems not improbable that a similar account
is to be given of the social position of the shepherds themselves, who,
though living on terms of Arcadian equality, appear to be sometimes
slaves or hirelings, sometimes independent proprietors: but the status
of their brethren in Theocritus is itsell a point which is apparently
involved in some uncertaiuty.

Such a systematic confusion of time, place, and circumstance, it will
be readily admitted, goesfar to justifythe way in which Virgil has
been spoken oi in the opening oi this essay as the great corruptor ol
