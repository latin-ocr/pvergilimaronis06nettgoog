P. VERGILI MARONIS

Nil radicis egent eliae, summumque putator
Haut dubitat terrae referens mandare cacumen.
Quin et caudicibus sectis, mirabile dictu,
Truditur e sicco radix oleagina ligno.
Et saepe alterius ramos impune videmus
Vertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala
Ferre pirum, et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.
Quare agite ο, proprios generatim discite cultus, 85
Agricolae, fructusque feros mollite colendo,
Neu segnes iaceant terrae. Iurat Ismara Baccho
