stance. A minute analysis of the langnage of 110 Eulogues is in truth
a school 01 poetioal criticism; and though the subtilty and complexity
01 110 images involved may induce a practice 01 over-refining 011 110 pert
01 110 inquiren yet experiente,I think, will show that the danger of
giving Virgil credit for more than he had in his mind is far less than
would 10 supposed by an ordinary reader.

[It is not possible to decide with certainty the date either 01 110
composition 01 0001 Eologue, 0101 110 publication 01 110 whole work.
virgil himself, at the end of the fourth Georgic, speaks of the Eclegnes
generally us the work 01 his youth, and this agrees with the statement
of Asconius (quoted by Probus and Servius9) that he wrote the Bucolics
in his twenty-ninth year (42 ac). The Ilclogues themselves do 1101
offer very much in the way 01 1111011101 evidence. If the fifth Eulogue
refers te Julius Caesar, it may be assigned 10 110 year 43 or 42 sc. In
, any 0000 11010 10 110 doubt that the second and third are earlier than
the fifth, and the fifth again than the ninth. 'Phe ninth cannot on any

hypothesis be dated later than the year 4001111 I have attempted 10
show in an excursus on this poem that it was written before the first,

and immediately after the territorial confiscatiens 01 41 uc. The first
cannot have been written earlier than the year 40, and may have
received its finishing touches later. Virgil speaks there not only cf

Ι 110 restoration 01 1101111111, but 01 altars which he has erected in

honour 01 Octavianus. Divine honours were not, 00 101 as we know,
publicly deoreed to Octavianus by the towns 01 Italy until 36 uc.
(Appian 5.132). It is uncertain whether the langnage 01 110 first
Eclogne warrants us in inferring that they were paid 10 him by pri·
vate individuale before this date, or whether the verses in question
were added by Virgil as late as 36, 01 whether the whole poem should
be assigned to this year.

The date 01 110 fourth Eclogne is fixed by that of Pollio's consulship
(40 aa), the eighth may with almost equal certainty be assigned 10
39, and the tenth has with much probability been referred to 37.
The date 01 110 seventh is unknown, and 1101 of the sixth quite
uncertain.

Suetonius (Vita Vergilii, 25), and after him Servius, say that Virgil
wrote the Eologues in three years: 0 statement probably based on tho
fact 1101 110 first Eclogue may be assigned to 40, and the last 10 37 uc.

Sehaper, followed by Baehrens, believes that the fourth, sixth, and
tenth Eclogues were written in the year ‘27-25 ac. and inserted by
Virgil in a second edition 01 110 Bucolica. Iagree with Ribbeck in
thinking that there are 110 solid grounds for this hypothesis. There is

⁹ Probus, Life 01 Virgil, and profare to Commentary on the Eelogues: Servius,
profanato Commentury on the Eulogues, and netes 10 1101. 1‚29‚ Georg. 4111.
