lxxiv THE AN OIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

already pointed. The coincidencee between N onius and Quintilian are
important, as indicating the existence of some work or werke on these
doubtful verbs in Quintiliau‘e own time: 101 Quintilian was not him-
self a grammarian, but used the collectione of professed scholare when
he had to touch on technical points 01 this kind. And Quintilian may
well have consulted either Pliny or Probus, or both.

In his Prolegomena to Virgil Ribbeck throws 001 0 hint that the
whole of the seventh book of N onius may, 10 hie opinion, be horrowed
from Probus. 11001 rather inclined to infer that it is derived, directly
or indirectly, from two sources. This conclusion 10,1 think, warranted
by the fact that even iu eo short a space the same note several times
occurs twice. This is the case with 00111101, which is illustrated 00
p. 472 from Lucilius, and 00 p. 475 from Afranius3 with parcior,
illustrated 00 p. 47l from Cicero, and 00 p. 479 with one of the same
passages 10 0 fuller form3 with amadacor, pp. 477 and 4793 with copa-
lor, pp. 476 0οᾶ 479; with miro, pp. 474 0οᾶ 480; with ruminor,
pp. 471 and 480; with moderant, pp. 471 and 4723 with lactc, pp. 468
0οᾶ 472. This phenomenon has already met 00 10 the two 11010 of
Priscian, and it seems natural to account for it in the 00010 way, vin,
hy supposing that there were two works in which the same 10010 were
dealt with and illustrated perhaps 10 0 great extent by the same
examplee. From these two worke the latter grammariane made up
their chaptere on noune and verbs, without taking the paine 10 avoid
treating of the same word twice. We know that two euch werke can
he ascribed to Pliny and Probus, and that Priscian drew largely upon
these two authore. The general resemblance between Priscian's chaptere
00 doubtful verbe and the seventh hook 01 Nouius makes it natural 10
10101 that it was from Pliny aud Probus that it was mainly compiled.

A fragment of the same lists ie preserved hy Diomedes, pp. sco-1,

who mentione frustro, patio, orere, demotis, 0000110, populo, and dipac:

{ndeeil hae shown that Diomedes, in hie section 00 the verb, followed
ro 00.

The other grammatical books 01 N onius (vm. IX. X. and XI.)
can be 10 like manner traced to Pliny, Probus, and Caper, or 01 least
to scholare 01 the first or early second century.

The point of this digression will now at length, I hope, he apparent
If it 000 be made highly probable that in two long grammatioal sectione
01 hie work Nonius was to 0 large extent, directly or indirectly, indebted
10 Probus,is it not also highly probable that in cases where hie remarks
on Virgil coincide with notes found in the later commentatore, as the
Verona, scholia, Servius, Philargyrine, and the Berne scholia, the agree·
ment is 10 he explained hya similar hypothesis? Itis impossible to
suppose that the later Virgilian commentatore horrowed from Nonius.
