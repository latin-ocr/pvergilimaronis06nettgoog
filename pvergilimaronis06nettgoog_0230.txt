ECLOGA X.

GALLUS.

Ir 1110010110001 friendship vvere but soautily aoknovrledged in thesixth and eighth
Eclogues, they are abundantly satislied in the present. which is entirely devoted to
Gallus. Like Varus, G. Cornelius Gallus issaid by Servius on Eclogue 6-13, 10 have
been Virgil's carly 00000ίο10 and follow-student nuder Siron. He is said 1)] the same
authority 10 have been appointed by the triumvirs to collect money 110111 those trans·
Pedana 1011110 whose lands vvere 10 be spared; and it is conjectured that he may 11010
been the Cornelius 11110, according 10 Serv, atteeked Alfenus Varus 111 0 spoech 101,
his division 01 1101110011 territory as unfair tc the inhabitants-one 01 both 01 which
munds would be sufficient 10 account for Virgil's connexion with him, even 11 the
story of their previous intimacy should bc deemed untrnstvvortlry. Besidcs, he had
been already admitted 10 Ρο1110’0 friendship, and 00 might easily vin the regard cf
Pollic’s protege. His further life need not be noticed herc: all ue have tc dc vith
is the fact that, as this Eclogue 0110110 01 the time of its composition, he had bonomo
11110111) 00 0 poet and 0 10101, having written elegies (tour 1100110, Serv. says), chiefly
sddressed 10 his mistress Lycoris, like Propertius’ to Cynthia, and 'libulfus' to Delia,
besides translating (11 that is to be considered 111111 Serv. a separate 1101111 some 01
the poems 01 Euphorion (note on v. 50). Lycoris ie identified 1)] Serv. nith Volumnia
Cytheris, a frecdwcmen 01 Volumnius Eutrapelus, and ct 0110 tirno mistress 01 Μ.
Antonius, vvhom the same account erronecusly represents as the rival mentioned v.
23. These elegies are repeatedly mentioned byOvid, 11110 appearstc have regarded
them 111111 high admiration, aad cuce, in au obscure passage (3. 26. 91, 92) 1)] Pro·
pertius: but only cue fragment 01 them survives, preserved by Vibius chnester, De
Fluminibus. p. 333.

11010, as in E. 1, the identification 01 the shephcrd and poet is sc radely managed
as 10 amount 10 absolute confusion. The subject cf the Eclogue is the hopeless and
absorbing passion 01 Gallus: Gallus, 11 1101 0 pastoral poet himself‚is the friend 01 0
pastoral poet, and 00011001 the pastoral company: accordingly he is represented 00
being 010110 and the same moment a soldier and a shephcrd, serving in the camp in
Italy, and lying undena roclr in Arcadia 111111 vcod-gods tc comfort him. As before,
the ualred simplicity 01 the explanation has caused it 10 be missod: Gallus has been
supposed to have gone 011 furiough 11110 Arcadia, 1111110 others, 11110 could not reconcile -
the langnage 01 v. 44 with his being in Arendin' at all, 11010 changed the tert.

The structure 01 the poem is 1011011 110111 the latter part 01 Theocr. Idyl 1. the dying
Daphnis supplying the model 101 Gallus, 1111000 despair however dces 1101 bring 11111
10 death. Virgil is supposed tonarrale the story in a song as he is tending his geals,
aud in rising 10 go home 101 the evening he gracefully intimatos 11101110 10 clcsing the
volume 01 pastoral poetry.

The time 10 commonly thought [though Ribbeck would date the poem earlier] tc
be tired by vv. 23, te full, and by general consideratious regnrding 1110 date 01 tha
Eologues, to the end 01 716 01 the beginning 01 717, when Agrippa 1100 leading an
expedition into Gaul aud across the Rhine, 111111 which Gallus’ 11101 10 supposed tc
11010 gone, while Gallus himself was engaged in 001110 uther service, perhapsin Italy
under 0011110100001111] against Sex. Pompeius 1111111147 seem tn point 10
winter or early spring,

The scenery seems 10 he Arcadian throughout, 01 least in the narrative part 011110
Eclogue.
