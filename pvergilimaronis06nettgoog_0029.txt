LIFE OF VIRGIL. xxv

In the year 31 came the battle of Actium in 29 Octavianus returned
to Italy from the East. Virgil, who with the assistance oi Maecenas
read the Georgius to him at Atella, seems tc have intended atthis time
to write an epic poem in celebratior of his exploits. The pcets were
busy upon the battle of Actium, and Virgil was for the time caught by
the general enthusiasm. But he cannot have entertained the idea for
long. Like Horace, he, for some reason cr other, seems to have

ebrunk from the direct celebratior cf the acta oi any person: thus iu
the sixth Eulogue he refuses tc perform this service for Varus. Per-
haps be thought, like Horace, that Varius was the right man to treet
such subjecta: Scriberis Vario sortis et testim Victor, Maeonii carminis
aliti. chever thia may be, he preferred a wider field, aud turned his
thoughts to the Aeneid.

He was engaged for the rest oi his life, teu years, on this great epic,
which he never lived to finish. Suetonius⁹ preserves a very important
notice regarding the manner in which the Aeneid was composed.
Virgil draited it iu prose, aud theu wrote the books iu no particular
order, but ,just as the fancy took him. This fact fully accounts for the
numerous inconsistencies in the narrative aa we bave it. The narrative
of the wanderings cf Aeneas in the third book is not to be reconciled
with that given in the first aud fifth3 the fifth interferes with the
cauma of eventa as namated iu the fourth aud sixth, and is inconsistent
with the sixth in its account of the death oi Palinurus.

There seems nc doubt that the third book was written before the
second. For iu the second Creusa foretells tc Aeneas that hc is
destined to come to the land of the Tibur, while iu the third he is
represented as acting in entire forgetfulness cf this prophecy: a fact
easily explained if we suppose that the second book was written
after the third. For the rest, there are very few notes of time to aid
us iu determiniug how Virgil distributed his work over the ten years
he was able to give to it. He must very soon after beginning his
labours have read parts of the new poem to bis friends. In apoem

pvritteu iu or about 26 ac. (3. 26), Propertius has the well-known
mes-

“ Gadita Romani scriptores, cedite Grai,
Nescio quid maius nascitur Iliade,''

which show that he was cue of the friends who were admitted by Ι
Virgil to listeu aud criticise.¹ I have elsewhere² endeavoured to

⁹ 23, “Aeneida prosa prius oratioue formatam digestamque iu xil. libros particu-
latim componare instituit, prout liberet quidque et nihil in ordinem arripleus.''

¹ Suetonius 33, “recitavit et pluribus, sed neque frequentaret ca icrc dc quibus
ambigebat, quo magis iudicium hominum experienter

² “ Aucieut Livas, &c.,'’ p. 67.
