lxii THE ANCIENT COMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

Several objections of his to points of detail iu Virgil’s lauguage and
in his management of his story have been preserved by Gellius and
Macrobius. He took exception to the word emesae in Ecl. 6. 76, where
Servius appeals to Probus in the poet's defense (comp. Gell. 2 6.). He
found fault with the conclusion oi the fourth Aeneid: “uude haeo
historie, nt crinis auferendus sit morientibus, ignoratur,” are his
words quoted in Macrobius 5. 19. 2. It was naturally replied that
Virgil was simply, following the Alcestis of Euripides. Not much
more attention need be paid to his complaiut that Virgil in Aen. 5.
488 has made Aeneas shoot a bird sacred to his own mother, or to his
criticisms (preserved by Gellius 9. 10.) of the wording of Aeneid 8. 405.

AEMILIUS ASPER,⁴

It is uncertain whether this distinguished scholar lived before or
efter Probus, The fact that uo mention is made of him by Suetonius
in his work De Illuciam Grammaticis makes very strongly in favour
of the later date3 nor can there be said to be any positive evidence for
the earlier one. It is true that in a note of the Verona scholia on
A. 9. 373, Asper is said to have raised a question with regard to the
word sublustris which was auswered by Probus: bnt this need prove

no more than that Asper, if he knew of the answer given by Probus,
was not satisfied by it. Nor cau anythiug be inferred from the fact
that on A. 10 539 Asper’s reading annis is mentioned before that
preferred by Probus, albis The conjecture of Bergk, who would read
Ασπερος for Avcpoe' m Suidas' notice of Heraclides Ponticus, could
only be accepted wereit tcertain ou other grounds that Asper lived ru
the reigno fOlaudins. Nothing again can be concluded from the fact
that the commentary on the lilclogues and Georgica which bears the
name of Probus quotes Aspersa an authority3 for (as we shall see
below) this commentary is probably in great part spurious.

However this may be, Asper was the author of a regular commentary
not only ou Virgil but on Terence and Sallust. A considerable
number of his notes are preserved, apparently iu their original form,

iu the Verona scholia. Others are ton be found iu Philargyrins and
Servius; and I have little doubt that much more of Asper’s work is
embodied in the commentary of Servius than its author chooses to
acknowledge. For if we compare the notes which the Verona scholia
expressly assigu to Asper with the correspondiug notes in Servius, we
constantly find that the latter has virtually the same comment in an
abridged form, and without any hint oi its source. From this fact we
