BUCOLICA. ECL. VIIl. 99

Sive oram Illyriei legis aequoris, en erit umquem
Ille dies, mihi oum lineet tua dicere laete?
En erit, ut lieest totum mihi ferre per orbem
Sole Sophocleo tua earmina digna coturno? 10
A te principium, tibi desinet. Accipe iussis
Carmina ooepts tuis, etque hano sine temporo eireum
Inter victrinis hederam tibi serpere laurus.

Frigido vix eaelo noetis decesserat umbro,
Cum ros in tenere peeori gratissimus herbe, 15
Inoambens tereti Damon sie eoepit olivae.
