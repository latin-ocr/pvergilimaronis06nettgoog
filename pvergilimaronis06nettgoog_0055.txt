VIRCIL AND HIS ANCIENT CRITICS. li

21, 11 10 remarked: “ 11000 pontifex tuns apud quas 0100 mactetur
ignorat, cnm vel aedituis haec nota sint et veterum non tacuerit
iudustria.” The attack 10 replied to; and both attach and reply are
abridged by Servius ou Aen. 3. 21 as follows: “ 001110 rationem Iovi
taurum sacrificat. . . ubique enim Iovi iuvencum legimns immola·
tum . . . adeo 1111110 putetur subsecutum esse prodigium.'’

Macrobius 3. 11. 1 : miti dilue Baccho: ia 11010011 laeti libant. 'Phe
attack aud reply are given in a shorter form in Servius on G. 1. 344
andhausida (Dan), ⁴⁴ quaeritur sane cur in mensam et non in 010111
libaverint,'’ &a But Servius has not the remarks on mitia and 01
1101001111 §§ 9 and 10.

3.12. 1 : Aen. 8. 285: on this alleged 90111000 0110101 Virgil Servius
(Dan.) has a note 11 substance much the same as that 01 Macrobius.

3. 12. 10: Aen. 4. 57: Virgil is said “toto 00010 0110000 cum Dido
sua rem divinam pro nuptiis iaceret Luciferae Cereri, dvc. 111 quasi
expergefactus adiecit Iunoni 01110 0111101,” 110.

Serv. A.4. 57(Dan.): “Alii dicunt hos deos quos commemoravit nuptiis
esse contrarios, Cereremque propter raptum filiae nuptias execratum,
1010. Male ergo invocat hos Dido, quaesibi nuptias optat Aeneae‚”
duc. Γ11101010 10 very long and 1111, 111 Isuspect that Macrobius, a frag·
ment only 01 whose comment remeius, has 1101001 the original wording.

Compare also Macrobius 1. 15. 10, with Servius on Aen. 8. 6543
Macrob. 1. 17. 4, with Serv. on Aen. l. 8.

The result 01 110 foregoing comparisons between Servius and
Macrobius is this: that 11 the great majority 01 00000 where Servius
and Macrobius have identical notes, those 01 Macrobius are 101110
fuller, 0100101, and more logical; that in the collectione 01 parallel
passages from Homer Macrobius 1100 some which Servius has not,
Servius many more which Macrobius has 101, aud there are many
in common. Hence the natural 111010100 10 101 (00 Ribbeck thinks)
that Macrobius was using a fuller 10111 01 the actual commentary 01
Servius than that which we now possess, but that both Macrobius
and Servius were drawing upon older commentarios and 0111101010.

Is it possible to say with any degree 01 certainty to whom these
works or any 01 them can be assigned?

Taking the hostile criticisms in 1100101110 and Servius first,
with the exception 01 those which 001 with certainty be assigned to
Cornutus and Hyginus (000 pp. lix.—lxi.), Ι would 0100110 that there
are 0 number 01 prccisely the same character aud 01101 worded 11 110
same vigorousandacrimonioussty103 I mean those which deal chiefly
with minute points 01 logio or narrative and less 01101 with points 01

expression. Such are (1) 110 1110101101Ιο remarks upon the 01110101
the narrative 11 the Aeneid (p. xxxv. 1011.); (2) those 11 which Virgil 10
