PREFAOE ΤΟ THE SEOOND EDITION. xi

pared by us in concert for publication: those on the first five
Eclogues are based on some which he composed by himself: and
many passages in both poema have since been discussed between
us. The editorial respousihility is however entirely mine, andI
have exercised it freely with reference to the materials which he
allowed me to use, adding, altering, and suppressing, as I deemed
best One important remark, affecting the interpretation of the
first Eologue, I have thought it right to assign distinctly to him, Ι
as it appears to me both new and valuable.2 On the other hand
Ilear it is not impossible that the notes may betray, here and
there, even after the present revision, a traca of that inconsistenoy
which is perhaps almost inseparable from a divided editorship,
though it is also conceivable that indicatione of this kind may
have arisen from changes in my own opinion, such as it is no less
natural to expect in the course of a protracted work.

Even a transient glauce at the contente of the present volume
will show that the production of it must necessarily have been a
work of time. It does not profess, indeed, any more than the
other editions of the Bibliotheca Classica, to be awork for the
learned, the result of elaborate original research. N o manuscripts
have been consulted in the formation of the text: a very large
portion of the notes may be found in the commentaries of others.
But it is no light thing to comment on nearly 3000 lines, line by
line, even where the materials of the note are taken from other
sources. Muoh too depende on the style in which a commentary -
is written. Ihave in general studied brevity of expression,
abridging quotations which might have been given in extenso,
and indicating a thought which might ¹easily have been pursued.
A very few lines of 'type will often represent the employment of
an honr. Before I knew the actual nature of the work, I fancied

that an edition of the whole of Virgil, such as I proposed, might
he completed in two or three years: Ι oan now only wonder at
the inexperience which suggested the thought.

In writing my notes I have had no one class of readers ex·
clusively in view, but have aimed at producing a commentary
which should contain such informaticn as is suited to the various .
