GEORGIOON LIB. III. 313

Atque ipsae memores redeunt in 10010, suosque

Ducunt, et gravido superant rix ubere limen.

Ergo omni studio glaciem ventosque nivalis,

Quo minor est illis curae mortalis egestas,

Avertes, victumque feres et virgea laetus ato
Pabula, nec tota claudes faenilia bruma.

At 1010 Zephyris cum laeta vocantibus aestas

In saltus utrumque gregem atque in pascua mittet,
Luciferi primo curn sidere frigida rura

Carpamus, dum mane norum, dum gramina canent, aaa
Et ros in tenera pecori gratissimus herba.

Inde, ubi quarta sitim caeli collegerit hora,

Et cantu querulae rumpent arbusta cicadae,

Ad puteos aut alta greges ad stagna iubebo
