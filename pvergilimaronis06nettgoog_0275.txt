some measure illustrated hythe elaborate episcde in which be tells how

that organizcd industry tc which the superhuman labours 01 110 Cyclopes

Book, 01 110 and 01 0 summary which speaks cf nothing but human
labour, an epithet is introduced which strikes 0 chord, 00 0000 1010
thought, cut ci barmcny with the context, by commemorating the
frugality 01 110 100 01ᾶο by side with tbe weight 01 experiauce required
ior rearing and keeping it. Ι1 1101 epithet was 001 intended, as it may
well bave been, to announce tc the reader that the poem would treet 01

Suetonius informs us that the composition 01 110 Georgica occupied

probably 717; the concluding lines 01 110 Georgica tell us that Virgil
was writiug while Caesar was conquering in the Reat, 0 tima which
seems most naturally to referto thevietorious progress 01 0010110000

Wagner’s inierence frum those lines, that 110 poem was entirely com-
