viii PREFACE

Mercier, which ie given in the editions both of Gerlach and
Quicherat. The references ιο Forbiger’s Virgil have been cor·
rected, where necessary, ιο snit his fourth edition, in which a
change or modification of his former views is sometimes observ·
able.

For the Life of Virgil prefixed ιο the previous editions I have
substituted show memoir, and have added three essays, on the
ancient critice of Virgil, on the ancient Virgilian commentatore,
