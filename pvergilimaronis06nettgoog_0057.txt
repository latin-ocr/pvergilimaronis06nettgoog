are simply pointed out, it is natural to assigu to the ὁμοιότητες oi
Octavius Avitns; whether this is also the case with the passages in
which Virgil is said to have drawn upon recondite Greek sources is, I
should think, doubtful, nor am I at present able to offer any hypothesis
on this point.

Turning tc the passages where virgil is defended against hostile
criticism, it is natural to suppose that when his alleged plagiarisms
from Homer, or alleged mistakes or want oi management in his narra·
tive are iu question, the ultimate source of the notes both in Servius
and Macrobius is the work of Asconius contro obtrectatores Vergilii.

It is less easy to conjecture what were the sources of the minute
verbal criticisms on which we dwelt at length in previous pagos3 but
there is considerable presumpticn that some of them at least are as
old as Verrius Flaccus. Ι have drawn out the following lists with a
view oi eliciting the points common to Macrobius with Nouius, Festus,
Gellius, Servius, Philargyrius, and the Verona scholia

Macrobius 6. 4. 2, additu: adfice et per hoc infesta. Ηοο iam dixerat
Lucilius in libro XIV. his versibus “Si mihi non praetor siet additus
atque agitet me.”

Servius Α 6. 90, additur: cst autem verbum Lucilii.

acro rus.
