P. VERGILI MARONIS

Albanoque Assyrio fucatur lana yeneno,

N ec casia liquidi corrumpitur usus olivi :

At secura quies et nescia fallere vita,

Dives opum variarum, stlatis otia fundis,

Speluncae, virique lacus, at frigida Tempe,

Mugitusque boum, mollesque sub arbore somni tre
Non absunt ; illic saltus ac lustra ferarum,

Et patiens operum exiguoque adsueta iuventus,

Sacra deum, sanctique patres; extrema per illos
Iustitia excedens terris vestigia fecit.
