GEORGICON LIB. ll. 279

any preponderance 01 authority ior the formos “ 11 ” is Δ. 9. 418, and there the only
extant uncials are Med.⁹ Pal, and Rom, the two former 01 which may pair off with
each other: in the other passages the weight, so iar as it falls anywhere, ialls
almost wholly on Rom. Rom, it should be mentioned, is wanting in the two first
cited passages, that before us (G. 2. 81), and A. 2. 497, in both 01 which it may pro-
bably have read “ exit,” though A. 10. 785 shows that the 1010101100 10 not absolutely
certain. But the fact is that Rom. almost invariably turns the perfect “iit ’² into
“ it,” not merely in compounds ol “eo ” but in other verbs. Not only is “audiit '’
constantiy written “ audit,” but in the two passages in l'irg. where it occupies the
flith place in 1110110110, A. 5. 239.‚ 7. 516, tho dactyl is made ont by reading “audit
et.'' In other passages ‘⁶ it'' is introduced in disregerd 01 the 1110110, as in A. 8. 363,
“ 1111111,” Α. 10, 67, “ petit‚’' unless we suppose the scribe to have intended the worda
either to be pronounoed ιι11111113 “ petyit,” or 10 be read as trisyllables‚ the second
“ i '’ being omitted in writing, as it is in the best MSS. in such words as ‘⁸ obicit,”
“ subicits’ The caso is the same with the double ‘⁶ i ‘’ in the perfect infinitivo, which
Rom. almost always writes single. 'Phe same phaenomena are occasionally observ·
able in Med.. Psl., and other-MSS. in Ribbech’s apparatus criticus, but to a far less
extant. On the other hand, instances are sometimes found where a transcribet has
written the double “ i ” 101 the single contrary to the 1110110. On the whole it would
seem that considerable confusion 011 the subject prewailed among the copyista, not
only 01 Virg, but (as in the instances cited from Nonius) 01 other authors, but thet
there is no evidence that it was due to any noticn about the quantity 01 the final
syllable 01 the perfect indicative 01 “00” and its compounds. The existence 01
“ ambiit ‘' 11 10, 243 (which ewen Rom. does not alter) is an argument 101 supposing
that Virg. did not recognize Lachmann's rulo, as though “ambio ’¹ is 1101 conjugated
throughout like “ exeo,” ‘⁸ transeo,” they must be at bottom the same, and “ exiet,'’
“ transiet,” following the analngy 01 ⁴‘ ambiet,” are not absolutely unknown 01011 10
classical latinityr Wagner argues against Lachmann’s doctrine in his Lecti. Vergg.
pp. 316 foll, though perhaps his main reason, 1110 inadmissibility 01 the rhythm
produced by ‘³ transit ” in A. 5. 274, savours rather 01 the arbitrariness 01 tho pre·
cept which he controverts: and I am glad 10 find that Mr. Munro in his 11010 on
Lucr. l.o. 101101 dismayed by his great predeoosaor's dictum ‘⁶ adeo grammatici nostri
00 quae quivis puer Romsnm sciebat neglegunt, nos autem senes ea operose quae·

rere cogimur quae nobis magistri nostri olim tradere debebant”
