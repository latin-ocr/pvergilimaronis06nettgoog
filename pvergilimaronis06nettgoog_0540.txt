420 ΟΝ THE LATER

Continuo saltu transcendens fervide senae
Vincla, rapit rictu primum portatque cubili,

Mox alium, mcx deinde alium: sic muscia mater
segregat egregiam subolem virtutis amore.”

The rest cf the poem is occupied partly with horsea, the points of a
good horse and the training which he requires being described in the
manner, though not quite with the ielicity, ef the Third Georgia,
partly with hunting implements; after which we are dismissed to the ,
chase rather abruptly:

“ His ita dispositis hiemis sub tempus aquosae
Incipe velocia catulos inmittere pratis,
Incipe cornipedes latos agitare per agros:
venemur, dum mane novum, dum mollia prata
Nocturnis calcata feris vestigia serrant.”

Two fragments of a poem cn Fowling (basatico or De Aacrrpio)
were printed in a Dialogus on Birds (1544) by Gibertus Longolins
who asserted that they had been transcribed for him fram a copy oi a
work by Nemesianus existing in a library at Bologna. Werdsdori, in
opposition to Ulitius, thinks them not unworthy of their reputed
author: botin any case they need not detain ns further.

The elder Pliny, in two passages of his Natural History‚⁴ speaks oi
a poem by ovid, entitled Holieaticu. A fragment on that subject with
Orid's name attached to it is found in a MS. containing part of
Gratins’ Cynegetica, and has been frequently printed in editions of
Gratius and Nemesianus, or as part of Ovid's works. It would perhaps
be too much to assign it to such illustrious parentage, though Haupt
thinks otherwise: but it would not disgrace either of the two poete

whom we hare just been considering. Take a specimen.

‘⁴ At contra seopulis cunali corpore segnis
Polypus haeret, et hac eludit retia fraude,
Et sub lege loci sumit mubtque colorem,
Semper ei similis quem contigit: etque ubi praedam
Pendentem saetis avidus rapit, hic quoque fallit
Elato calamo, cum demum emersus in auras
Bracchia dissolvit, populatumque exspuit hamum.
At mugil cauda pendentem everberat escam
Excussamque legit Lupus scri concitus ira
Discursu fertm vario, fluctusque terentis
Prosequitur, quassatque caput, dum volnere sacrm
Laxato cadat hamus, et ora patentis linquat”

Another fragment with the same argument was published by Hiero-
nymus Columna in his Commentary on the Fragments ot Ennius,

⁴ Book 32, chaps. 2 aud 11.
