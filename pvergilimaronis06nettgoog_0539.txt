DIDAC'I'IO POETS OF Ronn. 419

allowed ιο rank higher than the elder in command oi poetical imagery
and poeticai language: hie work however ie still more irngmentmy,
being evidently only a part oi what was originally intended, though
there are nottho seme marks ci actual imperfectior, and the number
of suspected readings seems to be smaller in proportiou. The thousand
ways oi hunting, the exhilaratiug teil, and the rapid evolutions oi
peacefnl rnrai strife, are Nemesianue’ subject3 a wholly new and uu·
tried one, as be telis ns, in apparent ignorance oi the leboura oi his
predecessor. This boasted novelty he proceeds ιο euiorce in the rhe-
torical spirit oi the passages which I quoted from Manilius, enumera·
ting at great length by way oi contrast the various subjecta which
other poeta have treated to exhaustiou. He then states his own in·

tentione more at large, and promisee, like virgil, at uo distant day ιο
sing of the exploits oi his imperial patrone, the two sons ci Carus.
Diana is theu involred‚ and iuvited to accoutre herself ior the chase,
with painted quiret, golden errove, purple bucinna, gold-embroidered
scari, jewelled belt, and wreath for the hair3 a eomewhat unseaeouable
inventory, imitated perhaps from the wardrobe oi a Homeric goddess,
but ae frigid in an invocatiou as it is appropriate in an antique epic
narrative. Afterthis introductiou oi 100 lines we come to the poem
iteelf, which takes up only 220 more. Nearly 140 oi these are given
to dogs, the chief stress being laid on the subject oi trainiug. Iwiil
quote a few, which go over part oi the ground traversed in the passage
cited from Gratius.

“Facundos aperit partus mature gravedo
Continuo, largaque vides strepere omnia prole:
Sed, quamvis avidus, primos contemnere partus
Melaena, mox uon omnis nutrire minores
Nam tibi si placitum populosoa pascme tetus,
Iam macie tennis sucique videbis inanis
Pugnantisque diu, quisnam prior ubera lambat,
Distrahere invalidam lassato viscere mairem.
liin vero haec cura est, melior ne forte necetur
Abdaturve domo, catulosque probare voluutas
Queis noudum gressm stabiles, nequa lumina passa ,
Luciferum videre iubar, quae prodidit usus
Percipe, et intrepidus spectatis adnue dictis.
Pondere narn catuli poteris perpendere vires,
corporibusque levis gravibus praenoscere cursu.
Quin et flammato ducatur linea longe
circuitu, signetque habilem vapor igneus orbem:
Impune in medio possis consistere circo.

Huc omnes catuli, hnc indiscreta teratur

Turba: dabit mater partus examine honestos,
Iudicio natos servans trepidoque periclo.

Nam postquam eondusa videt sua germina flaminia
