VIRGIL ΛΝΒ HIS ANOIENT ORITICS. xlix

Georg. 3. 391, munero cic niveo iaaac. Not Servius but Philargyrius
has this comment in a shorter form: “huius opinionis auctor est
Nicander: nec poterat csse nisi Graccus.”

The conclusion which Ι drnw from this comparisou is again that
Servius,¹ Philargyrius and Macrobius are drawing upon the same
source. And that this source was one work, not several, is, Ι think,
“ rendered probable by the uniformity cf stylo which characterizes the
whole of these notes as given in their fuller form by Macrobius. Add
Macrob. 1. 3. 10 on torquet medios ooo armiductores (Aen. 5. 738).

VII.

I now come 1ο a number of remarks in the third book of the Satur·
ualia, in which Virgil’s knowledge of religions antiquities is discussed.
As belone, Ι shall compare Macrobius and Servius on each note.

Macrob1us31: this note, on purificat ron by a running stream, is
abridged ιιι Servius on Aen. 4. 635.

3. 2. 1: Aen. 5. 237: porriciam and proiciam: again abridged' ιιι
Servius.

3. 2. 6: coti reus: “ vox propria sacrorum est,'’ doc. Sc Servius.

3. 2. 7: Aen. 4. 219: cram manibus apprehendere, arc aud coa.
Much of this note is iu Servius (Dan.) ou Aen. 4. 219 and 6. 124.

3. 2. 1οι attotam· lactum pacano: Aen. 6. 657: Servius is silent.

3. 2.15; facicm uitulo: Ecl. 3. 7 7 ι Servius in a note independent of
Macrobius says, ‘⁶ nt socium ture, facicm cqooJ'

3. 2. 17; Aen. 1. 373, et ocem coactae nostrorum andire nomm.-

’ Aeneas pontifex: Servius (Dan.) has the same note, bnt in a fuller

form.

3. 3. 2; samum, sunctum, profanam: Servius (Dan.) has the gistof this
note on Aen. 12. 779.

3. 3. 8: relictores, reticio: Servius (Dan.) has the same note, but
without mentioning Festus, ou Georg. 1. 269.

3. 4. 1 foll: delubrum: Servius (Dan.) on Aen. 4. 56 has the same
quotation from Varro, and on 2. 225 he quotes another note from
Masurius Sabinus (Dan). ,

3. 4. 6: Penates: so Servius (Dan.) ou Aen. 1. 378, 3. 119, 2. 296,

3. 5. l: leontice: so Servius ou Aen. 2. 119 (Dan), 3. 231, 456,

3. 5. 4; litore: sc Servius on Aen. 2. 119 (Dan.)

¹ Or rather his ancient interpolator. I do not however think it necessary 1ο sup·
pose that this writer is borrowing directly from Macrobius, as in other places he
either ignores him οι is quite independcut ol him· (See note on p. 1ιὶ below.)
