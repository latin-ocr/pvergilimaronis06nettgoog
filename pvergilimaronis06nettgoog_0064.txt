lx THE ANOIENT OOMMENTATORS ΟΝ VIRGIL.

refer (1) 10 the text, (2) 10 interpretation oi langnage, (3) to history
and antiquities, religious or political.

(1.) In Aen. 12. 120 he defended from Virgil's own manuscript the -

reading ‘⁴ velati licto: ” and iu Georgic 2. 247 0100101, appealing in
like manner 10 0 good MS. Gellius, 1. 21. 5, who gives ns this infor·
mation‚ remarks, “nou enim primns finxit hoc verbum Vergilius
insolenter, sed incarminibns Lucretii inventum 001, 000 001 aspernatus
auctoritatem poetae ingenii et facundiae praecellentis.'’ An observation
for which he may be indebted either 10 Hyginus or to Verrius Flaccus,
in whose works it is probable that there was a not inconsiderable
amount of common matter.

(2.) 1101110016. 6. 150100010θο a 001001 Hyginus upon the word
bidem, which he interprets as meaning a sheep with the two
prominent teeth which mark its fnll growth. Whether this interpre-
tation was due 1ο Hyginus or 10 Verrius Flaccus, whether either of
them horrowed it from the other, or both adopted it independently,
cannot be ascertained with certainty: but it is worth notice that the
explanation adopted by Hyginus is identical with that given in Paulus
p· 33, 0. v. bidental. In Aen. 6. 15, he ionnd fault with the expression
praepetibus penais.² His objection is not expressly notieed in tha com·
mentary 01 Servius, who, however, appears to be tacitly replyingto 11.
Audin 7. 187, he criticised the zeugma lituo et succinctus trabes.⁸

(3.) Hyginus, who had made considerable studies in Roman history,
was not slow to observa the error by which Virgil in the sixth Aeneid
(837) 00010000 tha conquerere of Macedonia and 01 Graece* Servius,
again without mentioning Hyginus, is at the pains 10 attempt a
solution of the difficulty which cannot be called successful. The same
is the 0000 with Hyginns’ remark on Aen. 6. 359, that Velia was not
founded at the time when Aeneas is represented 00 coming thither3¹
and with his observation that Theseus 10 spoken of at one time 00
remaining in hell for ever, and in another as an instance 01 0 hero who
had returned thence (Aen. 6. 122, 617). As the name of Hyginus is
not mentioned 10 these 00000 by Servius, it is natural to infer that his
criticisms were only known 10 the later commentator at second or third
hand. There are instances, however, in which Servius mentions
Hyginus by name. Thus he is quoted on Aen. 1. 277, 530, 00 points

connected with the early history of Rome and Italy; and οο 00 Aen.
2. 15, and 7. 47. His work De Urbibus Italicis is mentioned in general
1010ιο by Servius on Aen. 7. 678, and that De Familia noiant on Aen.
5. 389. Both works were probably much used by the later commen·
10101000 Virgil, and much of their contenta may have found their
way 1010 the 0010001 Servius.
